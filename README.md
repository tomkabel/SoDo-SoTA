**Make your AI coding assistant build and audit like your most senior engineer.**

Your assistant is brilliant — it just doesn't know your standards. SOTA-skills
teaches it: a library of Claude Code skills that encode state-of-the-art (2026)
practices for building **and** auditing software, and that verify their own
claims. 30 skills, 216 files, ~46k lines — every file under 500 lines, so the
right rules load exactly when your task needs them, never bloating the context
window. Fast-moving claims (versions, specs, regulations) are web-verified
against primary sources; last refresh: 2026-06-14.

Two cross-cutting pieces live outside the domain skills:

- `skills/sota/rules/01-audit-methodology.md` — how to run an audit: scoping &
  rules of engagement, a verified static-analysis tool matrix with triage
  discipline, the evidence standard (every finding carries severity, effort,
  standard mapping, and a concrete fix), and the report template (executive
  summary → findings → remediation roadmap by risk-reduction-per-effort →
  positive observations).
- `profiles/` — per-user stack profiles (preferred stores, auth, license
  policy, project triggers). The router treats a profile as the default in
  BUILD mode and the expected baseline in AUDIT mode, keeping the library
  itself generic and shareable.

## Structure

```
skills/
  sota/                          # master router — start here
    SKILL.md                     # routing, operating principles, workflows
    rules/
      01-audit-methodology.md    # how to audit: tooling, evidence, reporting
  sota-<domain>/
    SKILL.md                     # when to use, BUILD/AUDIT workflows,
                                 # severity conventions, rules index, top-10
    rules/
      01-<topic>.md              # 150–320 lines each, ends with an
      02-<topic>.md              # executable Audit checklist
      ...
profiles/
  <user>.md                      # personal stack defaults consulted by router
```

Every skill works in two modes:

- **BUILD** — apply the rules while designing/writing code.
- **AUDIT** — review existing code; findings are emitted as
  `file:line | rule violated | severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info) |
  effort (trivial/small/medium/large) | fix`.

## Installation

Skills are discovered from `.claude/skills/` (per project) or
`~/.claude/skills/` (personal, all projects).

**Personal (all projects):**

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for d in skills/*/; do ln -sfn "$(pwd)/$d" ~/.claude/skills/"$(basename "$d")"; done
```

**Per project:**

```sh
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.claude/skills
for d in skills/*/; do ln -sfn "$(pwd)/$d" /path/to/project/.claude/skills/"$(basename "$d")"; done
```

(Copy instead of symlink if you want the project pinned to a snapshot.)

## How it works

Claude Code matches your prompt against each skill's frontmatter description
and loads what's relevant automatically — you don't have to name a skill.
Naming one (or the `sota` router) just makes the routing explicit. From there:

1. The skill's `SKILL.md` loads first (workflows, severity conventions, an
   index of its `rules/` files). Only the rules files matching your task are
   read — never the whole library.
2. **BUILD mode** applies the rules while writing code and self-checks the
   diff against each loaded rules file's Audit checklist before presenting it.
3. **AUDIT mode** hunts violations and reports findings as
   `file:line | rule | severity | effort | fix`. Full audits follow
   `sota/rules/01-audit-methodology.md` (scoping → inventory → tooling →
   per-domain passes → report with a prioritized roadmap).
4. If `profiles/<you>.md` exists, its stack choices are BUILD defaults and the
   AUDIT baseline (deviations get flagged).

## Prompt examples

**Building:**

> Design a multi-tenant invoicing service — follow sota. Postgres, FastAPI.

> Add a websocket endpoint for live notifications, following SOTA practices.
> (→ api-design rules/05 + async backpressure + auth-at-upgrade rules)

> Build the settings page with sota-frontend-design — needs dark mode and
> WCAG 2.2 AA.

> Add a RAG search feature over our docs — use sota-llm-engineering, and
> write the evals first.

> Scaffold the GitHub Actions pipeline for this repo per sota-devsecops:
> SHA-pinned actions, OIDC, SBOM + signing.

**Auditing:**

> Run a full SOTA audit of this repo. Static analysis only, audit the current
> commit, report per the audit methodology.

> Audit this PR against sota-code-security and sota-golang before I merge it.

> Sweep the repo and git history for secrets per sota-secrets-management.
> Rotate-first recommendations for anything you find.

> Threat-model this service from the code: DFD, trust boundaries, STRIDE —
> sota-threat-modeling rules/06.

> Audit our Kubernetes manifests and Dockerfiles with sota-sandboxing and
> sota-devsecops. Severity + effort on every finding.

> Why is checkout slow? Profile-first per sota-performance — no guessing.

> Review our agent's MCP setup against the named attack taxonomy in
> sota-code-security rules/08 (tool poisoning, rug pulls, shadowing).

**Scoped & cross-cutting:**

> Is this migration zero-downtime safe? Check against sota-databases
> rules/02 (expand/contract, lock-aware DDL).

> Review test suite health: flaky policy, coverage ratchets, speed budgets
> (sota-testing rules/07).

> We're adding a "delete my account" feature — what does
> sota-privacy-compliance require for deletion propagation and retention?

> Check this bash deploy script with sota-shell-scripting before it goes
> into CI.

**Maintaining the library:**

> Refresh the library against current versions/advisories — re-verify the
> fast-moving claims and update the rules files (cite sources).

> Create profiles/<name>.md for my stack: <stores, auth, platform, policies>.

> Add a new skill for <domain>, same structure: SKILL.md + rules/ under
> 500 lines each, claims web-verified.

## Usage tips

- **Say the mode if ambiguous** — "audit", "review", "harden" vs "build",
  "add", "design". The skills key off those verbs.
- **Scope audits explicitly**: which commit/branch, static-only or
  may-run-tools, time budget ("crown jewels only"). The methodology file
  stops and asks otherwise.
- **Ask for the report format you want** — by default a full audit produces
  executive summary → findings by severity → roadmap by
  risk-reduction-per-effort → positive observations.
- **Stack skills freely**: language + domain ("sota-rust + sota-api-design
  for this axum service"). The router does this automatically when you just
  describe the task.
- **Re-verify anything version-sensitive**: the library's pinned facts are
  as-of the last refresh date above; the freshness-first principle tells the
  model to web-check before pinning versions — hold it to that.

## Conventions

- Every rules file ends with an **Audit checklist** (yes/no questions, often
  with grep/lint patterns to hunt violations).
- Severity scale everywhere: **Critical** (exploitable/data loss) · **High**
  (fix this sprint) · **Medium** (bounded impact) · **Low** (hygiene) ·
  **Info** (observations, no direct risk). Each finding also carries an
  **effort** estimate (trivial/small/medium/large) so remediation can be
  sequenced by risk-reduction-per-effort.
- Each SKILL.md carries a **top-10 non-negotiables** list — apply these
  unconditionally; load detailed rules files only as the task demands.
- Borderline severities state the deciding assumption; unconfirmed findings
  are marked "needs verification", never asserted.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: keep skills generic,
verify fast-moving claims against primary sources, keep every file ≤ 500 lines,
keep skill descriptions under 1024 characters, and end each rules file with an
audit checklist. These are enforced by `scripts/check-invariants.sh`
(pre-commit + CI) plus gitleaks. Security issues and conduct:
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
