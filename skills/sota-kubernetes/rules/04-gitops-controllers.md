# 04 — GitOps Controller Security (Argo CD, Flux)

Scope: the controller that reconciles git into the cluster — Argo CD and Flux. Its own
privileges and self-management risk, project/tenant scoping (the `clusterResourceWhitelist`
escalation trap), SSO/RBAC, repo/credential scoping, ApplicationSet/templating injection,
sync strategy, drift, recent CVEs, and promotion/rollback as git operations. CI/CD
*pipeline* and deployment *strategy* are `sota-devsecops` (rules/06); this file owns the
in-cluster controller's security model. SSO/OIDC *design* is `sota-identity-access`.

**Core principle:** GitOps is the *only* write path to the cluster. Humans don't `kubectl
apply` to prod — they open a PR; the controller reconciles the merged state. This makes
git the audit log and review gate, and makes the **controller a cluster-admin-class
component** whose compromise = cluster compromise. Scope it accordingly.

---

## 1. The controller is privileged — treat it as crown jewels

Argo CD's application-controller / Flux's controllers apply arbitrary manifests, so they
hold broad (often cluster-admin-equivalent) RBAC by design. Therefore:
- **The git repo + the controller's RBAC + who can change either = your real attack
  surface.** Anyone who can merge to the watched branch, or who can edit the controller's
  config, can deploy anything the controller can apply.
- **Branch protection + required review + signed commits** on GitOps repos are not
  optional (`sota-devsecops` rules/01). A self-approved merge to `main` is a deploy.
- **Self-management risk**: if the controller manages *its own* manifests (RBAC, config,
  the App that defines other Apps — "app-of-apps"), a malicious PR can widen its own
  privileges or repoint it at a hostile repo. Put the controller's own bootstrap under
  extra-tight review, or manage it out-of-band.
- Run the controller in its own namespace; restrict who has RBAC *to* Argo CD/Flux
  resources (Applications, AppProjects, GitRepositories, Kustomizations) — editing an
  Application is editing a deployment.

## 2. Argo CD AppProject scoping — the `clusterResourceWhitelist` trap

`AppProject` is Argo CD's tenancy/blast-radius boundary. It constrains which repos, which
destination clusters/namespaces, and which **resource kinds** an Application may deploy.
The traps:

```yaml
# BAD — a project that can deploy anything, anywhere, from any repo
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata: { name: team-a, namespace: argocd }
spec:
  sourceRepos: ["*"]
  destinations: [{ server: "*", namespace: "*" }]
  clusterResourceWhitelist: [{ group: "*", kind: "*" }]   # can create ClusterRoles, etc.
```

- **`clusterResourceWhitelist: [{group:'*',kind:'*'}]`** lets the project create *cluster-
  scoped* resources of any kind — including `ClusterRole`/`ClusterRoleBinding`. A tenant
  who can commit to that project's repo can bind themselves cluster-admin via a manifest.
  **Combined with broad SSO/RBAC into the project, this is Critical.** Allow only the
  specific cluster-scoped kinds the tenant legitimately needs (often *none* — leave it
  empty/unset so cluster resources are denied).
- **`sourceRepos: ["*"]`** lets the project deploy from any repo, defeating provenance.
  Pin to the exact repos.
- **`destinations` with `*`** lets one project write to every cluster/namespace. Pin to the
  tenant's clusters and namespaces.
- The **`default` AppProject is wide open** — don't run production Apps in it; lock it down
  (empty sourceRepos/destinations) and use named projects.
- Use `namespaceResourceBlacklist` / `clusterResourceBlacklist` to forbid dangerous kinds
  (e.g. `ResourceQuota`, `LimitRange`, RBAC) even within an otherwise-scoped project.

```yaml
# GOOD — scoped project; no cluster-scoped kinds, pinned repo + destination
spec:
  sourceRepos: ["https://github.com/org/team-a-config.git"]
  destinations: [{ server: "https://kubernetes.default.svc", namespace: "team-a-*" }]
  clusterResourceWhitelist: []        # cluster-scoped resources denied
  namespaceResourceBlacklist: [{ group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io", kind: "*" }]
```

## 3. SSO, RBAC, and credentials

- **SSO over local accounts.** Disable the built-in `admin` account in prod (`admin.
  enabled: false`) after bootstrap, or scope it to break-glass; rotate its secret. Wire
  OIDC/SSO (design → `sota-identity-access`).
- **Argo CD RBAC** (`policy.csv`): map SSO groups to roles; default policy `role:''`
  (no access). Scope roles to specific projects/Applications — not `role:admin` for
  everyone. The `g, <group>, role:admin` line is the equivalent of a cluster-admin binding.
- **Repository credentials are secrets**: scope read-only deploy keys / fine-grained PATs
  per-repo, store them as Argo CD repo Secrets (or via ESO — `sota-secrets-management`),
  never embed write creds. A controller with org-write git creds can poison source.
- **Cluster credentials**: when one Argo CD manages multiple clusters, each cluster
  credential is a foothold; scope and rotate them.

## 4. ApplicationSet & templating injection

ApplicationSet generates Applications from generators (git directories, PR/SCM, lists,
clusters). Generated fields are **templated** — untrusted input in a generator can inject
into the Application spec:
- **PR/SCM generators reading fork PRs** can let an external contributor influence
  generated Applications (repo URL, path, namespace) — treat like the `pull_request_target`
  problem (`sota-devsecops` rules/01). Restrict generators to trusted repos/branches; don't
  template attacker-controlled fields into `project`, `destination`, or `source`.
- Keep ApplicationSet `templatePatch`/Go-template values constrained; an injected
  `project:` field can move an App into a more-privileged AppProject.

## 5. Sync strategy & drift

- **Auto-sync vs sync-with-approval**: auto-sync makes a merge an immediate deploy — good
  for low-risk envs, paired with strong PR review. For prod, gate with manual sync /
  **sync windows** / approval so a merge doesn't instantly hit prod without a release step.
- **`selfHeal: true`** reverts out-of-band `kubectl` changes back to git — this is the
  point of GitOps (it kills drift and unaudited changes). Pair with **`prune: true`**
  carefully (prune deletes resources removed from git; a bad git change can delete prod).
- **Drift detection is a security signal**: an OutOfSync resource nobody changed in git
  means someone wrote to the cluster directly (or a controller is fighting). Alert on
  unexpected drift; investigate it as a possible intrusion, not just noise.
- **Promotion and rollback are git operations**: promote by moving a verified digest
  through environment overlays/branches (build-once-promote-many, `sota-devsecops`
  rules/06); roll back by reverting the git commit, not by hand-editing the cluster.

## 6. Patch the controller — recent Argo CD CVEs

The GitOps controller is high-value and has a live CVE stream; track and patch it like the
control plane (`rules/01` §7). Recent examples (verify against the Argo CD security
advisories before citing exact IDs/versions):
- **GHSA-3v3m-wc6v-x4x3 (CVE-2026-42880), ~May 2026, Critical** — Kubernetes Secret
  extraction via the ServerSideDiff feature: a low-privilege/read-only user could obtain
  plaintext Secret data. Patched in the then-current 3.2.x/3.3.x patch releases; upgrade.
- **GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff (CVE-2025-55190), Sep 2025, Critical (CVSS ~10)** — project API
  tokens with even `get` permission could retrieve repository credentials. Patched in
  2.13.9 / 2.14.16 / 3.0.14 / 3.1.2.
- Plus assorted webhook-parser DoS and stored-XSS (annotation) advisories.

Current Argo CD line is ~3.4.x (verify). Stay on a supported minor, watch the advisories
feed, and patch Critical auth/secret-exposure issues on the emergency track. Flux likewise
publishes advisories — track its controllers' CVEs.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] GitOps is the only write path to prod (no routine human `kubectl apply`); GitOps repos have branch protection + required review + signed commits?
- [ ] Controller runs least-privilege where possible; RBAC *to* Argo CD/Flux resources (Applications/AppProjects/Kustomizations) is restricted; self-management/bootstrap under extra review?
- [ ] No AppProject with `clusterResourceWhitelist: [{group:'*',kind:'*'}]` (or it's justified + tightly access-controlled)? (`kubectl get appprojects -A -o yaml | grep -A3 clusterResourceWhitelist`)
- [ ] AppProjects pin `sourceRepos` and `destinations` (no `*`); `default` project locked down; RBAC-creating kinds blacklisted where not needed?
- [ ] Argo CD SSO wired, built-in admin disabled/break-glass, RBAC `policy.csv` scoped per project (no blanket `role:admin`)?
- [ ] Repo/cluster credentials scoped (read-only deploy keys, per-repo), stored as secrets/ESO, rotated — no org-write creds in the controller?
- [ ] ApplicationSet generators restricted to trusted repos/branches; no untrusted input templated into `project`/`destination`/`source`?
- [ ] Prod sync gated (approval/sync windows), not blind auto-sync; `prune`/`selfHeal` reviewed; drift alerted and triaged as a security signal?
- [ ] Promotion = move verified digest through git; rollback = git revert (not hand-edits)?
- [ ] Argo CD/Flux on a supported version, CVE feed tracked, recent Critical advisories (Secret-extraction, cred-exposure) patched? (`argocd version`)
