# 03 — Offline-First, Background Work & Push

Mobile networks fail constantly — elevators, subways, captive portals, congested stadium cells — and the OS suspends or kills your process whenever it likes. Apps that treat connectivity and foreground execution as defaults exhibit the classic failure modes: infinite spinners, lost user input, duplicate writes, and "works until you background it." This file covers the three disciplines that prevent them.

## Offline-first

### 3.1 Declare the offline posture; if offline-first, the local DB is the source of truth

Two valid postures exist:

- **Online-only with designed failure UX** — acceptable when stale data is dangerous (live trading, dispatch). Every screen still needs a designed offline state: a clear banner and disabled actions, not a spinner that never resolves.
- **Offline-first** — the default for content, messaging, productivity, and field-work apps.

For offline-first, one structural rule generates everything else: **the UI reads only from the local database, and the network writes into the database.**

- DB options: Room/SQLDelight (Android/KMP), GRDB/SwiftData/Core Data (iOS), SQLite/WatermelonDB/op-sqlite (RN), Drift (Flutter).
- Screens observe the DB reactively (Room `Flow`, GRDB `ValueObservation`, Drift watches). The UI never renders a network response directly.
- This kills the cache-coherence problem dead: one copy of truth on device, and every screen observing it updates together. No "list shows the old title after editing on the detail screen."

```kotlin
// BAD: screen state = network response; other screens show stale copies;
// offline = spinner forever
class OrdersVM(private val api: OrdersApi) : ViewModel() {
    suspend fun load() { _state.value = Loaded(api.getOrders()) }
}

// GOOD: DB is truth; network refreshes DB; all observers update together
class OrdersRepository(private val api: OrdersApi, private val dao: OrdersDao) {
    fun orders(): Flow<List<Order>> =
        dao.observeOrders().map { it.map(OrderEntity::toDomain) }   // UI reads this

    suspend fun refresh(): RefreshResult = try {
        val page = api.getOrders(since = dao.syncCursor())
        dao.transaction {
            dao.upsertAll(page.orders.map(::toEntity))
            dao.saveSyncCursor(page.nextCursor)
        }
        RefreshResult.Ok
    } catch (e: IOException) { RefreshResult.Offline }              // data still renders
}
```

```swift
// GOOD (iOS/GRDB): observation drives the screen; refresh is a side concern
func observeOrders() -> AsyncValueObservation<[Order]> {
    ValueObservation.tracking { db in try Order.fetchAll(db) }.values(in: dbQueue)
}
```

### 3.2 Queue mutations in a persistent outbox; make every mutation idempotent

Writes made offline — or on links that die mid-request, which is the same thing — go into an **outbox table**, not fire-and-forget coroutines:

- Each queued mutation carries a **client-generated idempotency key** (UUIDv4/v7), sent as a header or field; the server deduplicates on it. Without this, retries create duplicate orders, posts, and payments. Any retrying write path without idempotency keys is a HIGH audit finding.
- The queue drains via the platform scheduler (3.6/3.7) with exponential backoff and jitter, preserving **per-aggregate ordering** (two edits to the same record must not reorder; edits to different records may parallelize).
- Outbox rows survive process death (they're DB rows in the same transaction as the optimistic local write — atomicity matters: local change and its queued upload commit together or not at all).
- **Poison-message policy:** after N terminal failures (4xx that isn't auth/409), stop retrying, surface to the user, and report to telemetry. An outbox that retries a permanently rejected mutation forever burns battery and hides data loss.

```sql
CREATE TABLE outbox (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- idempotency key, sent to server
  aggregate_id TEXT NOT NULL,     -- ordering scope
  op TEXT NOT NULL,               -- 'order.cancel', payload JSON below
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,
  base_version INTEGER,           -- for conflict detection (3.4)
  attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### 3.3 Optimistic UI with visible pending state and visible rollback

- Apply the mutation locally immediately — write to the DB with `pending` status in the same transaction as the outbox row — and let the observing UI update instantly.
- Render pending state subtly once it's older than a few seconds (dimmed row, clock glyph). Users on bad networks deserve to know what hasn't landed yet.
- On terminal failure: roll back the local change **and tell the user** ("Couldn't post your comment — tap to retry"). Silently reverting an edit is data loss from the user's perspective and erodes trust in every future optimistic update.

### 3.4 Choose a conflict-resolution strategy per entity, explicitly

"Last write wins" is a decision, not a default you fall into. The escalation ladder, cheapest first:

1. **LWW with server timestamps** — fine for single-writer data (the user's own settings from their own devices, mostly).
2. **Field-level merge** — server merges non-overlapping field updates, rejects overlapping ones back to the client.
3. **Version preconditions** — the client sends `base_version` it edited against; server returns 409 + current state on mismatch; client merges or asks the user. The right default for shared business records.
4. **CRDTs / dedicated sync engines** — for genuinely collaborative data (shared documents, multi-user checklists). Prefer an existing engine or CRDT library over hand-rolling; hand-rolled sync protocols are multi-year bug farms with corruption-shaped failure modes.

Write the chosen strategy per entity in the repo (a table in the sync design doc). Auditors: offline-writable entity with no stated strategy = MEDIUM; concurrently-edited data under blind LWW = HIGH (it silently destroys user input).

### 3.5 Sync protocol hygiene

- **Delta sync** with a server-issued cursor (`since` token), never repeated full downloads. The server must handle "cursor too old/invalid" with an explicit full-resync signal, and the client must implement it — the untested resync path is where year-old installs break.
- Tombstones: deletions must sync as explicit records, or deleted items resurrect from stale caches.
- Detect connectivity by **attempting the request**, not by trusting reachability APIs — captive portals report "connected" while blackholing traffic. Reachability/`ConnectivityManager` signals are for *deferring* retries, never for *gating* attempts.
- Sync work is: off the main thread, batched, compressed, cancellable, and resumable mid-batch (commit progress per page, not at the end).
- Instrument it: sync success rate, drain latency, queue depth, and conflict rate are product health metrics, not nice-to-haves.

## Background work

### 3.6 iOS: background execution is a budgeted privilege, not a capability

- Use `BGTaskScheduler`: `BGAppRefreshTask` for short periodic refresh, `BGProcessingTask` for longer maintenance (with `requiresNetworkConnectivity`/`requiresExternalPower` set honestly). The OS schedules based on user habits and battery — treat scheduling as a **hint**. Anything that *must* happen also happens on next foreground.
- Every task registers an **expiration handler**, checkpoints progress, and calls `setTaskCompleted(success:)`. Tasks that run to the buzzer get throttled in future scheduling.
- Large uploads/downloads use **background `URLSession`** — transfers continue after process death and relaunch the app on completion. Keeping a process alive to babysit a transfer is the wrong tool and will be killed.
- Dedicated background modes (location, audio, VoIP/PushKit) only when the product genuinely *is* that feature — App Review rejects mode abuse, and PushKit VoIP pushes that don't present calls get the app killed.
- **Silent pushes (`content-available: 1`) are throttled and best-effort:** budgeted to roughly a few per hour, dropped under battery pressure, and never delivered to force-quit apps. An architecture that *requires* silent push delivery is broken by design. Use them only as a "sync sooner" accelerant layered over pull-based sync that works without them.

```swift
BGTaskScheduler.shared.register(forTaskWithIdentifier: "com.app.outbox", using: nil) { task in
    let work = Task { await syncEngine.drainOutbox(checkpointing: true) }
    task.expirationHandler = { work.cancel() }          // mandatory
    Task { task.setTaskCompleted(success: await work.value) }
}
```

### 3.7 Android: WorkManager for deferrable work; respect Doze, don't fight it

- **WorkManager** is the default for all deferrable-guaranteed work (sync, outbox drain, uploads): constraints (`NETWORK_CONNECTED`, charging), exponential backoff, **unique work names** (`enqueueUniqueWork` — without them, every trigger enqueues a duplicate chain), and persistence across reboots.

```kotlin
val drain = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<OutboxWorker>()
    .setConstraints(Constraints(requiredNetworkType = NetworkType.CONNECTED))
    .setBackoffCriteria(BackoffPolicy.EXPONENTIAL, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    .build()
WorkManager.getInstance(ctx)
    .enqueueUniqueWork("outbox-drain", ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP, drain)
```

- **Doze and App Standby Buckets** will batch and defer your work — that's the contract. Do not fight them with `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` alarms or wakelocks for routine sync. Exact alarms are permission-gated and policy-reviewed; they're for user-facing scheduled moments (an actual alarm, a medication reminder), nothing else.
- **Foreground services** only for user-initiated, user-visible ongoing work (playback, navigation, active workout) with the correct `foregroundServiceType` declared — Play policy enforces declared types and rejects misuse. "Foreground service to keep sync alive" is both a policy violation and a battery-review magnet.
- `BroadcastReceiver.onReceive` does nothing but delegate to WorkManager — slow receivers ANR (rules/05).
- FCM **high-priority** messages punch through Doze, but repeated delivery without a user-visible result causes the platform to deprioritize your app's messages. Reserve high priority for genuinely time-critical user-facing events (incoming call, ride arriving); everything else is normal priority.

### 3.8 Every background job is idempotent, checkpointed, and time-indifferent

The universal contract both platforms converge on: background time can end mid-instruction. Therefore every job is written to be resumable from a checkpoint, idempotent on re-run (3.2 keys), and indifferent to running now versus in three hours. If the product genuinely demands real-time guarantees, that is a foreground feature or a server-side feature — not a background hack, because there is no reliable background on modern mobile OSes.

## Push notifications

### 3.9 Token lifecycle is server-side state with hygiene

- Fetch the APNs/FCM token on every launch and on the rotation callbacks (`didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken`, `onNewToken`) — tokens rotate on reinstall, restore-from-backup, and OS updates. Upload on change, keyed to **device + account**, with app version and environment (sandbox/prod APNs mixups are a classic "push works in dev only" bug).
- Process feedback: delete tokens on APNs 410/`Unregistered` and FCM `UNREGISTERED` responses. A token table that only grows means paying to push to ghosts and corrupting delivery metrics.
- **On logout, disassociate the token from the account server-side immediately.** Pushing user A's message previews to a device now logged in as user B is a CRITICAL privacy finding — and it happens by default if logout only clears local state.
- Server side: use token-based APNs auth (p8 key), batch sends, and respect collapse IDs to replace stale notifications instead of stacking them.

### 3.10 Push is a doorbell, not a delivery truck

Push delivery is at-most-once, unordered, size-limited (~4 KB), and transits third-party infrastructure. Therefore:

- The payload carries **identifiers and a collapse key, not data of record**. The app fetches truth from the API/DB on tap or in the background handler. State synced via push payloads diverges the first time a push is dropped — and pushes are dropped daily.
- Minimize sensitive content in payloads (it appears on lock screens and in transit metadata). When the product needs rich-but-private notifications, use the iOS **Notification Service Extension** / FCM data-message handler to fetch or decrypt content on-device before display.
- Never put auth tokens or signed URLs with broad scope in payloads (rules/04 §4.4).

### 3.11 Rich, actionable, and well-channeled notifications

- iOS: Notification Service Extension for attachments/decryption — it gets ~30 seconds and a tight memory cap, so it must degrade to plain text gracefully, never crash (a crashing NSE silently drops your notification content). Categories + actions for inline reply/approve; communication-style notifications and interruption levels used honestly (`time-sensitive` for genuinely time-sensitive things, or users revoke it).
- Android: **channels are mandatory UX architecture** — one channel per user-meaningful category ("Order updates", "Promotions"), with honest default importance, so users can mute marketing without muting the product. One channel for everything earns app-level mutes and uninstalls.
- Every notification deep-links to the **exact content** (route-as-data, rules/02 §2.7) through the validated deep-link pipeline (rules/04 §4.6) — landing on the home screen after tapping "Your order shipped" is a quality bug users notice.
- Localize and collapse: use collapse IDs / `setGroup` so ten events become one stacked notification, not ten rows.

### 3.12 Ask for notification permission in context, never at first launch

Android 13+ requires the runtime `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission; iOS always has. Both give you effectively **one** clean shot at the system prompt:

- Sequence: the user takes an action whose value depends on notifications ("notify me when it ships") → show your own pre-prompt explaining the concrete value → only then fire the system prompt. Acceptance rates double or better versus prompt-at-launch.
- On denial: degrade gracefully, surface a settings deep link *from the relevant feature*, and don't nag on a timer.
- iOS **provisional authorization** (quiet delivery to Notification Center without any prompt) is a legitimate warm-up: deliver value first, ask for full alerts later.
- A system permission prompt on first launch, before the user has seen any value, is an automatic MEDIUM finding: it maximizes the denial rate and permanently burns the only shot.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Offline posture documented; online-only screens have designed failure states (no infinite spinners).
- [ ] Offline-first: UI reads exclusively from the local DB via reactive observation; network writes into the DB; no screen renders a network response directly.
- [ ] Mutations persisted in an outbox, committed atomically with the optimistic local write; client idempotency keys sent and deduplicated server-side; per-aggregate ordering preserved; poison-message policy exists.
- [ ] Optimistic updates show pending state and roll back visibly with a retry affordance on terminal failure.
- [ ] Conflict strategy written down per offline-writable entity; concurrent-edit data is not blind LWW; 409/merge path implemented and tested.
- [ ] Delta sync with cursor + tombstones + tested full-resync path; connectivity probed by attempting requests, not reachability flags; sync metrics instrumented.
- [ ] iOS: BGTaskScheduler with expiration handlers and completion calls; background URLSession for large transfers; background modes match the product; nothing *depends* on silent push delivery.
- [ ] Android: WorkManager with constraints/backoff/unique names; no exact alarms or wakelocks for routine sync; foreground services only user-visible with declared types; receivers delegate immediately; FCM high priority reserved for time-critical user-facing events.
- [ ] Every background job idempotent, checkpointed, and correct whether it runs now or hours late.
- [ ] Push tokens uploaded on rotation, keyed to device+account, deleted on feedback, disassociated on logout (verified — this is the privacy-critical one).
- [ ] Push payloads carry IDs/collapse keys, not data of record or secrets; rich content fetched/decrypted on-device; NSE degrades gracefully.
- [ ] Android channels map to user-meaningful categories; notifications deep-link to exact content via the validated route pipeline; collapse/grouping used.
- [ ] Notification permission requested in context with a pre-prompt; provisional auth considered on iOS; denial path designed; never prompted at first launch.
