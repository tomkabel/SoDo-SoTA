# 03 — Distributed Systems, Messaging & Eventing

Rules for any system where two components are separated by a network. The
network will partition, messages will duplicate and reorder, clocks will lie.
Design for that on day one; it cannot be patched in later.

## 1. CAP/PACELC: pick trade-offs per operation, not per system

**Rule:** During a partition you choose consistency or availability; even
without a partition you choose latency or consistency (PACELC). Make the choice
*per operation*, write it down (ADR), and verify the datastore's defaults match.
"We use a CP database" is not a design; "balance reads are linearizable,
product-view reads are eventually consistent with ≤5 s staleness" is.

**Rule:** Never assume read-your-writes across replicas or caches. If a flow
needs it (user saves, next page shows the save), engineer it explicitly: sticky
session to primary, version-pinned reads, or write-through cache.

**Rule:** Distrust distributed transactions (2PC/XA) across heterogeneous
systems. Coordinators block on failure and availability collapses to the worst
participant. Prefer sagas (§5) and the outbox (§4).

## 2. Idempotency is mandatory, everywhere

**Rule:** Every message handler, every retried API call, and every job must be
safe to execute at least twice. Delivery guarantees are at-least-once in
practice (§3), so non-idempotent consumers corrupt data — it's a when, not an if.

**Mechanisms, in order of preference:**
1. Naturally idempotent operations (`set status = 'shipped'`, upsert by key).
2. Idempotency key: caller supplies a key; handler records `(key → result)` and
   replays the stored result on duplicates. Store key + result *in the same
   transaction* as the state change.
3. Version/sequence checks: reject events older than current aggregate version.

```text
GOOD (dedupe inside the TX):
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO processed(msg_id) VALUES ($id)   -- unique constraint
      ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; IF no row inserted: ROLLBACK, ACK, return
    ...apply state change...
  COMMIT; ACK

BAD: if redis.exists(msg_id): skip      -- check and write not atomic;
     apply(); redis.set(msg_id)         -- crash between = duplicate apply
```

**Rule:** Public write APIs accept an `Idempotency-Key` header (or equivalent)
and document retention. Payment-ish operations without idempotency keys are a
Critical finding.

## 3. Exactly-once delivery is a myth; exactly-once *processing* is yours to build

**Rule:** No broker gives you end-to-end exactly-once across your database and
side effects. "Exactly-once" broker features (Kafka transactions) cover
broker-internal read-process-write only. Your contract is: at-least-once
delivery + idempotent processing = effectively-once outcomes. Any design doc
that depends on exactly-once delivery is wrong; fix the design, not the broker.

**Rule:** Acknowledge messages only after the state change is durably committed.
Ack-then-process loses messages on crash; process-then-ack duplicates them —
which is fine, because §2.

## 4. Outbox pattern: never dual-write

**Rule:** Never write to your database and publish to a broker as two separate
operations — a crash between them either loses the event or emits a phantom.
Write the event into an `outbox` table in the same transaction as the state
change; a relay (poller or CDC e.g. Debezium) publishes from the outbox.

```text
BEGIN
  UPDATE orders SET status='placed' WHERE id=$1;
  INSERT INTO outbox(event_id, type, payload, created_at) VALUES (...);
COMMIT
-- relay: SELECT unpublished → publish → mark published (at-least-once; consumers dedupe)
```

**Rule:** The same applies inbound: to atomically consume and act, use an inbox
table (record msg_id + effects in one TX), then ack.

## 5. Sagas for cross-service workflows

**Rule:** A business transaction spanning services is a saga: a sequence of
local transactions, each with a **compensating action** for rollback. Define
compensations at design time; a saga step without a compensation (or an explicit
"pivot — no return past this point" marker) is undesigned failure handling.

**Orchestration vs choreography:**
- **Orchestrate** (explicit coordinator / workflow engine: Temporal, Step
  Functions, or a state-machine table) when steps ≥ 3, ordering matters, or you
  need to answer "where is order 123 stuck?". Default choice.
- **Choreograph** (each service reacts to events) only for short, stable, 2–3
  step flows. Beyond that, the workflow exists only in engineers' heads —
  unauditable and undebuggable.

**Rule:** Compensations are not undo. `cancelReservation` after `reserveStock`
must handle "stock already shipped". Compensations are themselves idempotent,
retried, and may need their own compensations escalated to humans (incident
queue), which must be designed, not improvised.

**Rule:** Every saga has a timeout and a terminal failure state visible in
monitoring. Sagas stuck "in progress" for hours are a High finding.

## 6. Event-driven architecture: events are facts

**Rule:** An event states a fact that happened (`PaymentCaptured`), in past
tense, owned by the producer. A command requests work (`CapturePayment`), owned
by the consumer. Don't disguise commands as events ("EmailShouldBeSent") — that
inverts ownership and creates hidden coupling.

**Rule:** Producers don't know consumers. If producer code must change when a
consumer is added, you have RPC over a message bus, not eventing.

**Rule:** Consumers must tolerate: duplicates (§2), reordering (use aggregate
version numbers or partition-key ordering, never wall-clock timestamps), and
unknown fields (forward-compatible deserialization).

**Rule:** Use CQRS only where read and write shapes genuinely diverge (complex
domains, heavy read fan-out, projections per consumer). CQRS does not require
event sourcing; start with "write model + projected read tables". Event sourcing
is a Type 1 decision — adopt only with replay/audit requirements and ops
capacity for snapshotting, upcasting, and GDPR-compliant deletion (crypto-
shredding), each of which must be designed before adoption.

## 7. Queues: DLQs, ordering, backpressure

**Rule:** Every queue/subscription has: a max-retry policy with backoff, a
dead-letter queue, an alert on DLQ depth > 0, and a documented + tested
redrive procedure. A DLQ nobody drains is a data-loss buffer with extra steps.

**Rule:** Distinguish poison messages (malformed/bug — will never succeed; DLQ
immediately after schema validation fails) from transient failures (dependency
down; retry with backoff). Retrying poison messages 10 times just delays the DLQ
and burns ordering.

**Rule:** Ordering is per-partition-key only. Pick the partition key = the
entity whose events must be ordered (order_id, account_id). Global ordering
doesn't scale; don't design flows that require it.

**Rule:** Backpressure is designed, not discovered:
- Bounded queues everywhere (unbounded queues turn overload into OOM + huge latency).
- Consumers pull at their own rate; producers get pushback (block, shed, or buffer-with-bound).
- Define the overload policy per queue: shed lowest-priority work first (see rules/04 §6).
- Monitor consumer lag with alerts; lag growing monotonically = under-provisioned consumer or poison loop.

## 7b. Broker queues (AMQP/RabbitMQ): semantics the log model misses

AMQP-style brokers delete on ack and *push* to consumers — different failure
modes than Kafka-style logs:

**Rule:** Manual ack only after the state change is durably committed (§3
applied to AMQP) — never auto-ack: messages count as delivered once written to
the TCP socket, so a consumer crash under auto-ack loses them silently. With
manual acks, unacked deliveries requeue on channel/connection close — which is
why §2 idempotency is mandatory here too.

**Rule:** Nack/requeue is a decision, not a reflex. Requeue only transient
failures; every consumer requeueing the same delivery is a redelivery storm
(CPU + bandwidth burn). Poison messages are rejected with `requeue=false` to a
dead-letter exchange after validation fails (§7), with redelivery count bounded.

**Rule:** Consumer prefetch (`basic.qos`) is the backpressure knob. AMQP pushes,
so the cap on unacked deliveries is your only bound; unset/0 = unlimited
prefetch = an unbounded buffer in the consumer (and memory growth on the node).
Set it explicitly: ~100–300 for fast handlers, low single digits for heavy
ones (sota-async-concurrency rules/06).

**Rule:** Claim-check pattern: messages carry references (entity IDs,
object-store URLs), never large blobs and never secrets — the broker is a
shared failure domain, not storage. Payloads stay small, schema'd (§8), with
correlation IDs (§9).

**Rule:** Quorum queues are the default for anything that must survive node
loss. Classic queue mirroring was removed in RabbitMQ 4.0; classic queues are
single-replica now. Quorum queues default to delivery-limit 20 — messages
exceeding it are dead-lettered or *dropped*, so configure the DLX target; and
default dead-lettering is at-most-once — where DLQ loss is unacceptable, set
`dead-letter-strategy: at-least-once` + `overflow: reject-publish`.

**Rule:** Broker hardening in one line: per-service users, vhost isolation,
least-privilege configure/write/read permissions, TLS, and no default `guest`
account beyond localhost dev — details in sota-cloud-infrastructure and
sota-secrets-management.

## 8. Contracts and schema evolution

**Rule:** Every cross-service message and API has an explicit, versioned schema
(OpenAPI, protobuf, Avro/JSON Schema in a registry) with compatibility checks in
CI. Changes are additive by default (expand/contract): add optional field →
migrate consumers → remove old field. Breaking changes require a new version
published alongside the old, with a deprecation window.

**Rule:** Use consumer-driven contract tests (Pact or equivalent) or a schema
registry with compatibility mode — one of the two, enforced in CI. "We'll
coordinate releases in Slack" is the distributed monolith (rules/07).

**Rule:** Tolerant reader: consumers ignore unknown fields and validate only
what they use. Strict full-payload validation on consume turns every producer
addition into your outage.

## 9. Time, IDs, and causality

**Rule:** Never use wall-clock timestamps for ordering or uniqueness across
machines. Use per-aggregate version numbers for ordering, UUIDv7/ULID/KSUID
for IDs (sortable, collision-free), and the database for authoritative time
where one exists.

**Rule:** Propagate correlation/trace context (W3C traceparent) through every
hop — HTTP, queue message headers, scheduled jobs. A distributed flow you can't
trace end-to-end is undebuggable; this is an audit-blocking gap, not polish.

## 10. Async request/response done right

**Rule:** When a caller needs an answer but the work is async, use correlation
explicitly: caller sends command with `correlation_id` + reply channel (reply
queue, callback URL, or polling endpoint with job status), worker replies with
the same `correlation_id`. Define the no-reply timeout and its user-facing
behavior up front.

**Rule:** Job-status resources beat held connections: `POST /exports → 202 +
/jobs/123`, then poll or push notification. States exposed: `queued → running →
succeeded(result_url) | failed(error, retryable?)`. Every async API the system
offers should converge on one such job pattern, not five bespoke ones.

## 11. Competing consumers and partition assignment

**Rule:** Scale consumers via the competing-consumers pattern, but know your
broker's unit of parallelism (Kafka: partitions; SQS: messages; AMQP: prefetch).
Max useful consumers = partition count in partitioned brokers; provision
partitions for target parallelism *at topic creation* — repartitioning later
breaks key→partition ordering during the transition.

**Rule:** Keep per-message work small and uniform. One 10-minute message behind
500 fast ones on the same partition is head-of-line blocking; split heavy work
into a separate queue/topic with its own consumers (bulkheads, rules/04 §4).

**Rule:** Handle rebalances: consumers must expect partition reassignment
mid-stream (commit offsets only after processing; idempotency §2 covers the
overlap window).

## 12. Distributed coordination: avoid it, then do it right

**Rule:** The best lock is no lock: partition the work (each worker owns a key
range), or let the database arbitrate via constraints and conditional updates
(`UPDATE ... WHERE version = $expected`). Reach for distributed locks only when
neither applies.

**Rule:** If you must lock distributed-ly: use a lease (lock with TTL +
fencing token), never an unbounded lock — holders crash. Verify the fencing
token at the resource, not just at acquisition; a paused process can wake up
believing it still holds an expired lock.

```text
GOOD: token = lock.acquire(ttl=30s)        # token = monotonically increasing
      storage.write(data, fence=token)      # storage rejects stale tokens
BAD:  if redis.setnx(key): do_work()        # GC pause > TTL → two holders, no fence
```

**Rule:** Singleton jobs (schedulers, relays) use leader election (lease in
etcd/DB/k8s Lease) with the same fencing discipline, and must be idempotent
anyway because elections overlap.

## 13. The fallacies, applied

Design reviews must not contain these assumptions; each appears in real designs
weekly:
- "The call will succeed" — every remote call needs a failure branch with a decision (retry? degrade? surface?), not just a log line.
- "Latency is negligible" — N sequential cross-service calls = N × RTT floor; budget it (rules/04 §1).
- "Bandwidth is infinite" — fat events/payloads (full entity snapshots on every change) saturate brokers; send deltas + version, or IDs + hot fields.
- "Topology doesn't change" — pin nothing to instance identity; discovery via the platform (DNS/service registry), connections re-resolve on failure.
- "The clock is right" — clock skew between machines is unbounded for ordering purposes (§9); never compare timestamps from two machines to decide order or expiry of anything critical.

## Audit checklist

- Is the consistency model (linearizable vs eventual, staleness bound) written down per critical operation?
- Is every message handler and retried endpoint provably idempotent? Is dedupe state committed atomically with the state change?
- Do public write APIs accept idempotency keys?
- Does anything depend on exactly-once *delivery*? Any naked dual-writes (DB write + publish without outbox/CDC)?
- Does every multi-service workflow have defined, idempotent compensations and a timeout-to-terminal-failure path? Can you answer "where is workflow X stuck" from a dashboard?
- Are events past-tense facts with producer ownership, or commands in disguise?
- Does every queue have bounded size, retry-with-backoff, DLQ, DLQ alerting, and a tested redrive runbook?
- Are poison messages separated from transient failures, or retried identically?
- AMQP consumers: manual ack after durable commit (no auto-ack)? Requeue limited to transient failures, with poison messages rejected (`requeue=false`) to a DLX?
- Is prefetch (`basic.qos`) set explicitly on every AMQP consumer, or is any consumer running with unlimited prefetch?
- Durable RabbitMQ queues: quorum (not classic), delivery-limit dead-lettering configured (not silently dropping)? Messages carry references rather than blobs/secrets? Broker locked down (per-service users, vhosts, least privilege, TLS)?
- Is ordering guaranteed only where a partition key provides it? Any logic assuming global order or wall-clock ordering?
- Are message/API schemas versioned with CI compatibility checks or consumer-driven contract tests?
- Are consumers tolerant readers (ignore unknown fields)?
- Is trace/correlation context propagated across every async hop?
- If event sourcing is used: are snapshotting, upcasting, and deletion (crypto-shredding) designed and tested?
- Do async request/response flows use correlation IDs and a standard job-status pattern with defined no-reply timeouts?
- Is consumer parallelism aligned with broker partitioning? Any head-of-line blocking from mixed-weight messages on one queue?
- Are distributed locks lease-based with fencing tokens verified at the resource? Any bare `setnx`-style locks guarding critical sections?
- Are singleton/scheduled jobs leader-elected and idempotent under overlapping elections?
- Do any designs assume reliable network, ordered clocks, or stable topology (check failure branches on every remote call)?
