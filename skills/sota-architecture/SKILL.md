  State-of-the-art software and system architecture rules (2026) for both building and auditing. Use this skill whenever the task involves designing, building, refactoring, or extending system architecture (choosing monolith vs microservices vs serverless, defining service/module boundaries, domain modeling, DDD, hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven design, CQRS, sagas, message queues, caching, sharding, multi-tenancy, resilience, scalability, 12-factor/cloud-native setup, feature flags, ADRs) — AND whenever the task is to audit, review, or assess existing architecture or code for architectural quality (architecture review, design review, code review of service boundaries, finding anti-patterns like distributed monolith or shared database, reliability/resilience review, scalability assessment). Trigger keywords: architecture, system design, microservices, monolith, serverless, bounded context, DDD, aggregate, hexagonal, clean architecture, event-driven, Kafka, NATS, JetStream, message bus, message broker, messaging, pub/sub, stream, consumer, queue, saga, outbox, idempotency, CQRS, resilience, circuit breaker, retry, timeout, backpressure, caching, sharding, partitioning, multi-tenant, 12-factor, cloud-native, feature flag, ADR, scalability, anti-pattern, design review, architecture audit.

# SOTA Architecture (2026)

## Purpose

Dense, enforceable rules for software and system architecture: choosing styles,
drawing boundaries, surviving distributed systems, scaling state, and shipping
cloud-natively. One rule set, two modes — apply the rules while **building**,
or check code against them while **auditing**. All substance lives in `rules/`;
this file routes you to the right one.

## BUILD mode — designing or writing code

1. **Identify the decision surface.** Before writing code, list the architectural
   decisions in play (style, boundaries, sync/async, datastore, tenancy, caching).
   Use the index below to read the relevant rules files *before* committing to a
   design — minimum: 01 for any new system/service, 03 for anything crossing a
   network, 07 always (know what failure looks like).
2. **Default to boring.** Modular monolith, one database, sync calls within the
   deadline budget, queues only where semantics are async. Escalate complexity
   only when a rule's stated forces apply, and record it.
3. **Write the ADR first** for any Type 1 (hard to reverse) decision: context,
   decision, consequences (must include downsides), rejected alternatives. Put it
   in `docs/adr/`.
4. **Apply rules as you code, not after.** Timeouts/retries/idempotency at every
   integration point as you create it; ports before adapters; tenant_id and trace
   context plumbed from the first commit. Retrofitting these is 10x the cost.
5. **Encode the rules you adopted as fitness functions** (import-rule tests,
   contract tests in CI, SLO alerts) so they survive you.
6. **Before finishing**, run the relevant "Audit checklist" sections from each
   rules file you used against your own output. Fix what fails or document why
   it's accepted (in the ADR).

## AUDIT mode — reviewing existing code or designs

1. **Scope first.** Identify what you're auditing (whole system, one service, one
   PR) and read the matching rules files from the index. For a full architecture
   audit, work through all seven; for a PR, pick by topic.
2. **Drive from the checklists.** Every rules file ends with an "Audit checklist"
   of yes/no questions — answer each with evidence (file:line, config, trace),
   never from the README's claims. Use rules/07 detection signals as concrete
   grep/inspection targets.
3. **Verify mechanically where possible:** grep for client construction without
   timeouts, imports crossing layers, queries missing tenant scoping, `latest`
   image tags, dual-writes (DB write + publish in the same function without an
   outbox), shared DB credentials.
4. **Report every violation as a finding** in this exact format:

   ```
   [SEVERITY] file:line — Rule violated: <rules-file §section, short rule name>
   Evidence: <what you observed>
   Impact: <what fails and when>
   Fix: <specific, smallest correct remediation>
   ```

5. **Severity conventions:**
   - **Critical** — data loss/corruption, cross-tenant leak, full-outage mechanism, money/security path failing open: missing idempotency on payments, business data only in cache, shared-DB writes, liveness probe checking the DB, secrets in git, no owning team.
   - **High** — outage-magnifier or rollback-blocker: missing timeouts on hot paths, retry multiplication, lockstep deploys, breaking schema changes, sync chains > 2 on revenue paths, DLQ without alerting, missing read-your-writes on user-visible saves.
   - **Medium** — erodes evolvability/operability: leaky abstractions, anemic core domain, stale feature flags, missing ADRs, event spaghetti without cycles, unscoped shared libs.
   - **Low** — hygiene: naming drifting from ubiquitous language, missing runbook sections, unjittered crons that haven't yet caused incidents.
   - When in doubt between two severities on a revenue-, security-, or data-touching path, pick the higher.
6. **Summarize** findings by severity with counts, then list the top 3 structural
   themes (not symptoms) and the order to fix them (Critical correctness →
   rollback/deploy safety → evolvability).

## Top-10 non-negotiables

Check these on every build and every audit, regardless of scope:

1. **Every remote call has an explicit timeout**, sized from measured latency, fitting the edge deadline budget. (04 §1)
2. **Every message handler and retried operation is idempotent**, with dedupe state committed atomically with the state change. (03 §2)
3. **No dual-writes**: DB state change + event publish happen via outbox/CDC, never as two independent writes. (03 §4)
4. **One writer-owner per table**; services never integrate through a shared database. (07 §2)
5. **Dependencies point inward**: domain imports no framework/ORM/vendor/transport types — enforced by an automated architecture test, not convention. (02 §5)
6. **Retries are bounded, jittered, idempotent-only, and owned by exactly one layer** per edge. (04 §2)
7. **Every queue has bounded size, a DLQ with alerting, and a tested redrive procedure.** (03 §7)
8. **Tenant/user scoping is enforced below application code** (RLS or mandatory scoped layer) and present in every query, cache key, message, and log line. (05 §7)
9. **Cross-service contracts (APIs and events) are versioned with CI compatibility checks**; changes are expand/contract; previous code version must still run (rollback-safe). (03 §8, 06 §7)
10. **Every Type 1 decision has an ADR with consequences and rejected alternatives**, and every prod component has exactly one owning team. (01 §4, §7)

A violation of any of these is at minimum High severity; most are Critical on
data-, money-, or security-touching paths.
