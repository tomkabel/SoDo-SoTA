# SOTA Docs & Engineering Workflow

## Purpose

Expert-level rules for the artifacts around the code: documentation (structure,
reference, freshness, runbooks) and the collaboration workflow (PRs, review,
commits, releases). These are the highest-leverage, lowest-glamour practices —
review latency and doc decay quietly dominate team throughput. Rules are
imperative with rationale and good/bad examples; every rules file ends with an
audit checklist. Load only the files relevant to the task via the index below.

Boundaries: ADR practice lives in `sota-architecture`; API contract design in
`sota-api-design`; tag signing/provenance and CI supply chain in
`sota-devsecops`. This skill references them rather than repeating them.

## BUILD mode

When creating docs or setting up workflow:

1. **Classify before writing.** Every doc is exactly one Diátaxis mode
   (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation) and is titled accordingly;
   mixed-mode pages are the defect to design out (`rules/01` §1).
2. **Docs live with the code**: in-repo, PR-reviewed, CI link-checked, examples
   executed. If a doc can't change in the same PR as the code, it will decay
   (`rules/01` §2, §4).
3. **README = what / why / 5-minute quickstart / honest status**, then links
   out (`rules/01` §3). Runbooks are alert-linked and command-exact
   (`rules/01` §5).
4. **Reference is generated** from OpenAPI/docstrings/rustdoc/godoc with
   warnings-as-errors; doc comments carry the why, contract, and failure
   modes; examples run in CI (`rules/02` §1–4).
5. **Changelog from day one**: Keep a Changelog format, `Unreleased` section
   updated in the PR that makes the change, user-impact language
   (`rules/02` §6).
6. **Workflow defaults**: small single-purpose PRs with what/why/how-tested
   descriptions (`rules/03` §1–2); trunk-based short-lived branches; atomic
   commits with imperative ≤72-char subjects; conventional commits only if
   automation consumes them (`rules/04` §1–3).
7. **Agent docs**: one short, human-curated AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md with exact
   commands and repo-specific traps — never auto-generated bloat
   (`rules/01` §7).
8. Before declaring done, self-review against the relevant files' **Audit
   checklists**.

## AUDIT mode

When auditing docs or workflow:

1. Scope the surfaces: docs tree + README + runbooks (`rules/01`), generated
   reference + changelog + migration guides (`rules/02`), recent PRs and review
   threads (`rules/03`), git history, branches, and tags (`rules/04`).
2. **Audit reality, not policy.** Sample artifacts: run the quickstart on a
   clean environment, follow a runbook's commands, read 10 docstrings, read the
   last 20 merged PRs and 50 commits, diff a recent minor release for breaking
   changes. A CONTRIBUTING.md full of rules nobody follows is itself a finding.
3. Work through each loaded file's **Audit checklist**; probe the classic gaps:
   tutorial that fails partway, stale docs contradicting code, README
   quickstart requiring tribal knowledge, alert with no runbook, `default:
   Error` as the only documented failure, changelog that's a commit dump,
   2,000-line rubber-stamped PRs, force-push during review, broken commits on
   main, moved release tags, gitflow on a continuous-deploy service.

### Severity conventions

- **Critical** — actively dangerous artifacts: runbook whose commands are wrong
  or destructive without warning; docs instructing insecure practice (secrets
  in config examples, auth bypass); moved/deleted published release tag;
  breaking change shipped in a minor/patch with no notice; merge to default
  branch with no review or required checks at all.
- **High** — reliably costs incidents or releases: page-able alerts without
  runbooks; quickstart/tutorial that fails; published docs contradicting
  current released behavior; no changelog or migration guide across breaking
  releases; review rubber-stamping (large PRs, instant LGTMs, AI volume merged
  unread); non-bisectable main (broken commits); releases built outside CI.
- **Medium** — erodes trust and throughput: mixed Diátaxis modes; undocumented
  public symbols or name-restating docstrings; unexecuted doc examples; no
  link-checking; PR descriptions missing why/how-tested; review SLA routinely
  blown; long-lived feature branches; commit-dump changelog; conventional
  commits adopted without enforcement or automation.
- **Low** — polish: missing freshness dates; vanity/stale badges; unlabeled
  nit comments; subject lines over 72 chars; missing `.git-blame-ignore-revs`
  for reformat commits; docs index drift.

### Finding format

```
[SEVERITY] <one-line title>
Where: <file:line | doc URL | PR/commit ref | branch/tag>
Rule: <rules-file §section>
Issue: <what is wrong, with observed evidence (quote the doc/PR/commit)>
Impact: <concrete consequence — who is misled, what breaks, what it costs>
Fix: <specific change; corrected text/command/process where load-bearing>
```

Order by severity; one finding per root cause; every finding cites sampled
evidence (a doc you executed, a PR you read) — no findings from vibes.

## Top-10 non-negotiables

1. **One Diátaxis mode per document** — tutorials teach, how-tos accomplish,
   reference informs, explanation contextualizes; titles declare which.
   (rules/01 §1)
2. **Docs are code**: in-repo, PR-reviewed, link-checked in CI; behavior
   changes update docs in the same PR. (rules/01 §2)
3. **Wrong docs are worse than none** — own every doc, date-review the
   operational ones, delete stale pages instead of archiving them. (rules/01 §4)
4. **Every page-able alert links to a command-exact, incident-tested runbook.**
   (rules/01 §5)
5. **Reference generated from source with undocumented-public-symbol as a build
   failure; doc examples compile and run in CI.** (rules/02 §1–3)
6. **Document failure modes**: every operation states what can fail and what
   the caller should do; error messages point toward the fix. (rules/02 §4)
7. **Changelog in Keep a Changelog form, written in user-impact language,
   updated in the PR — and breaking changes ship with a migration guide after a
   deprecation period.** (rules/02 §6–7)
8. **Small, single-purpose PRs with what/why/how-tested descriptions; first
   review response within one business day.** (rules/03 §1–3)
9. **The review bar is provenance-blind**: AI-generated code gets the same
   scrutiny, and style/lint/type findings are CI's job, never a human's.
   (rules/03 §6–7)
10. **Main is always green and bisectable; published tags are immutable;
    version numbers keep SemVer's promises with breaking changes announced
    before they're shipped.** (rules/04 §1, §4–5)
