# SOTA Databases

Expert-level rules for the full lifecycle of a data layer: choosing an engine,
modeling data, evolving schemas safely, writing efficient queries, handling
concurrency, operating reliably at scale, securing data, and supporting
vector/AI workloads. Postgres is the reference engine; rules call out where
other systems (MySQL, Redis, document/columnar/vector stores) differ.

This skill operates in two modes. Determine the mode from the user's intent,
then load the relevant `rules/` files per the index below. Do not load all
files preemptively — pick by task.

## BUILD mode

Use when designing or implementing: new schemas, migrations, queries, ORM
layers, caching, job queues, or database infrastructure.

1. **Engine and model first.** Read `rules/01-choosing-and-modeling.md` before
   writing any DDL. Default to Postgres unless a rule there says otherwise.
2. **Every schema change is a migration.** Never hand the user raw DDL to run
   ad hoc; produce migration files following `rules/02-schema-migrations.md`
   (expand/contract, lock-aware, reversible-or-documented).
3. **Design indexes with the queries, not after.** When writing a query that
   will run in production, state which index serves it. Follow
   `rules/03-queries-and-indexes.md`.
4. **State the concurrency story.** For any write path: idempotency, isolation
   level, locking strategy, retry behavior (`rules/04-transactions-concurrency.md`).
5. **Operational defaults are part of the design.** Pooling, backups,
   monitoring hooks, and retention are not "later" items
   (`rules/05-reliability-and-scale.md`, `rules/06-security-and-compliance.md`).
6. Prefer boring, well-trodden patterns. Novelty in the data layer is a cost,
   not a feature.

## AUDIT mode

Use when reviewing an existing schema, migration set, query workload, ORM
usage, or database configuration.

Procedure:
1. Inventory: engine + version, schema (tables, indexes, constraints),
   migration tooling, ORM, pooling setup, backup/replication config.
2. Load the rules files matching what exists (e.g., no vectors → skip 07).
3. Check each rule; report deviations as findings. Verify claims against the
   actual schema/queries — never report a finding you have not confirmed in
   the code or DDL.

Severity conventions:
- **CRITICAL** — data loss, corruption, or breach is likely or already
  possible: untested/missing backups, SQL injection, unconstrained deletes,
  missing FK causing orphaned money/auth rows, RLS bypass, plaintext secrets.
- **HIGH** — production incident waiting to happen: non-CONCURRENT index on a
  hot table, table rewrite migration without expand/contract, missing unique
  constraint under concurrent writes, unbounded long transactions, no
  lock_timeout in migrations, offset pagination on large tables in hot paths.
- **MEDIUM** — correctness or performance debt: N+1 queries, SELECT *, missing
  composite index for a known query, soft delete without partial indexes,
  natural primary keys, missing updated_at/audit trail where required.
- **LOW** — hygiene: naming inconsistencies, missing comments on cryptic
  columns, redundant indexes, suboptimal types (e.g., varchar(255) cargo cult).

Finding format (one per finding):
```
[SEVERITY] <short title>
Where: <file:line | table/column | migration id>
Rule: <rules file + rule heading>
Evidence: <the offending DDL/SQL/code, quoted>
Impact: <what breaks, when, under what load>
Fix: <concrete change — exact SQL/DDL/code where possible>
```
Order findings by severity. End with a summary table: count per severity, and
the top 3 fixes by risk-reduction-per-effort.

## Rules index

| File | Read this when... |
|------|-------------------|
| `rules/01-choosing-and-modeling.md` | Picking an engine (SQL vs NoSQL/KV/columnar/time-series/vector); designing tables; deciding normalization, JSONB usage, primary keys, soft deletes, audit/history tables, or multi-tenancy. |
| `rules/02-schema-migrations.md` | Writing or reviewing any migration; altering hot tables; planning zero-downtime schema changes; backfills; setting up migration tooling or testing. |
| `rules/03-queries-and-indexes.md` | Writing/reviewing queries or ORM code; reading EXPLAIN ANALYZE; choosing index types or composite column order; pagination; N+1 suspicion; CTEs and window functions. |
| `rules/04-transactions-concurrency.md` | Anything with concurrent writes: isolation levels, locking (FOR UPDATE, SKIP LOCKED, advisory), job queues, idempotency, deadlocks, long transactions, connection pooling. |
| `rules/05-reliability-and-scale.md` | Backups/PITR, replication and read replicas, partitioning, vacuum/bloat, monitoring, capacity planning, sharding decisions, Redis caching patterns and distributed locks. |
| `rules/06-security-and-compliance.md` | DB roles and grants, RLS, encryption at rest/in transit, SQL injection surface, PII columns, data retention and GDPR-style deletion. |
| `rules/07-vector-and-ai.md` | Embeddings, semantic/hybrid search, pgvector vs dedicated vector DBs (incl. Qdrant exposure hardening), embedding model versioning and re-indexing. |
| `rules/08-surrealdb-multimodel.md` | Building on or auditing SurrealDB: DEFINE ACCESS auth, system users and least privilege, parameterized SurrealQL, SCHEMAFULL + PERMISSIONS, capability flags, indexes, multi-model (embed/reference/graph edges), backups. |

## Top 10 non-negotiables

Violations of these are at minimum HIGH severity in AUDIT mode and must not be
introduced in BUILD mode.

1. **Postgres until proven otherwise.** A second datastore needs a written
   reason that Postgres (with JSONB, partitioning, pgvector, LISTEN/NOTIFY)
   cannot meet — not a vibe.
2. **No natural primary keys.** Surrogate keys only: `bigint GENERATED ALWAYS
   AS IDENTITY` internally, UUIDv7 when IDs are exposed or generated
   client-side. Never email, SSN, slug, or composite business fields as PK.
3. **Expand/contract, always.** No migration may break the currently deployed
   application version. Add → migrate code → backfill → contract, as separate
   deploys.
4. **Lock-aware DDL on hot tables.** `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `SET
   lock_timeout`, batched backfills, `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`.
   Never an unbounded `ALTER TABLE` rewrite or blocking index build on a
   table with traffic.
5. **Constraints in the database, not only the app.** Uniqueness, foreign
   keys, NOT NULL, and CHECK live in the schema. Application-level "validation
   only" uniqueness is a race condition, not a constraint.
6. **Every production query has a known index.** If you cannot name the index
   a query uses (or justify a seq scan), the query is not done. Keyset
   pagination, no `SELECT *`, no N+1.
7. **Idempotent writes on every retryable path.** Unique keys, upserts, or
   idempotency keys — any write that a client, queue, or webhook may retry
   must be safe to execute twice.
8. **A backup that has not been restored is not a backup.** PITR configured,
   restores rehearsed, RPO/RTO stated. Replication is not backup.
9. **Least privilege at the database.** The app role owns no schema, cannot
   DROP, and cannot read tables it does not use. Migrations run as a separate
   role. No superuser connection strings in app config.
10. **Transactions are short.** No network calls, no user waits, no batch
    loops inside a transaction. Long transactions cause bloat, lock queues,
    and replication lag — treat any transaction over ~1s as a design bug.
