# 08 — Registry Security (the registry as a supply-chain trust anchor)

Scope: the container/artifact **registry itself** as infrastructure. rules/04 covers how the
image is built and pushed; rules/02 covers signing and provenance; this file covers the box
that holds them — who can write to it, who can read from it, what it guarantees about the
bytes it serves, and what happens when it is internet-exposed with auth turned off.

The registry is **tier-0**: every image the cluster runs flows through it. An
anonymously-writable registry is cluster-wide RCE — an attacker re-pushes a trusted tag, the
next rollout pulls it, and you are running their code with your service account. Admission-time
*enforcement* of what may be pulled (signature verify, registry allowlist, digest pinning) lives
in the **sota-kubernetes** skill; network exposure controls reference **sota-network-security**;
running the registry workload itself hardened references **sota-sandboxing**. This file is the
registry's own posture.

## 8.1 The trust-anchor model — why this is tier-0

- The registry sits on the critical path of every deploy. Compromise it and you do not need to
  compromise CI, source, or the cluster: you change what the cluster *pulls*. This is the same
  authority as repo-write or CI-secret theft, often with worse detection (no PR, no audit trail).
- Three things must hold for the registry to be a trust anchor, not a liability:
  1. **Only trusted writers can push** (no anonymous, no shared creds, CI-scoped identities).
  2. **What a consumer pulls is immutable and verifiable** (immutable tags, digest pinning,
     signatures that get *verified* — rules/02 produces them, sota-kubernetes enforces them).
  3. **The registry is available and recoverable** (tier-0 dependency; if it is down, you cannot
     deploy or scale, and if it is lost, you cannot reconstruct without source rebuilds).
- Audit framing: a registry that fails (1) is **Critical** (anonymous/shared push = artifact
  injection). Failing (2) is **High** (tag mutation, no verification). Failing (3) is **Medium**
  (availability/recovery), **High** if it is also the only copy of release artifacts.

## 8.2 AuthN/AuthZ — no anonymous write, least-privilege everything

**Rule: no anonymous push, ever. Usually no anonymous pull either.** Anonymous pull is
defensible only for a deliberate public-mirror registry on an isolated network path — never on
the same instance that holds private images.

The real finding (Zot, self-hosted): the registry ran with **anonymous push+pull on a
`hostNetwork` port** because the auth/accessControl mount was left **commented out**. That is
Critical: any pod on the node network (and anything that can reach the host port) can push a
`:prod` tag. The commented-mount pattern is the hunt — config that *looks* secured in the repo
but is disabled at deploy.

```json
// BAD — Zot with no auth, anonymous everything (the finding)
{
  "http": { "address": "0.0.0.0", "port": 5000 }
  // "accessControl": { ... }   <-- mount commented out; defaults to anonymous read+write
}
```

```json
// GOOD — Zot: authenticated, anonymous denied, per-repo least privilege
{
  "http": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1", "port": 5000,
    "tls": { "cert": "/etc/zot/tls/cert.pem", "key": "/etc/zot/tls/key.pem" },
    "auth": { "openid": { "providers": { "oidc": {
      "issuer": "https://idp.internal", "clientid": "zot", "scopes": ["openid","email"] } } } },
    "accessControl": {
      "repositories": {
        "team-a/**": {
          "anonymousPolicy": [],                         // no anonymous access
          "defaultPolicy": ["read"],                     // authed users: pull
          "policies": [
            { "users": ["ci-team-a"], "actions": ["read","create","update"] }  // CI may push
          ]
        }
      },
      "adminPolicy": { "users": ["registry-admin"], "actions": ["read","create","update","delete"] }
    }
  }
}
```

- **htpasswd is the floor, not the target.** Static basic-auth credentials get shared, copied
  into CI as one blob, and never rotated. Prefer **OIDC / bearer-token** auth, and **mTLS** where
  clients are machines you control. Zot v2 supports OIDC (incl. dex/GitHub/Google/GitLab), LDAP,
  bearer-token, and mTLS with identity extraction from the peer cert (verified, v2.1.x). Harbor
  authenticates humans via OIDC/LDAP and machines via **robot accounts**.
- **Separate push and pull identities.** Runtime nodes get a **pull-only** credential scoped to
  the namespaces they run; CI gets a **push** credential scoped per-repo. A single read-write
  cred shared by both means a leaked node kubelet secret can rewrite prod images.
- **Robot/CI accounts are per-repo and expiring.** Harbor robot accounts carry scoped actions +
  expiration; Zot policies scope `actions` per repo pattern to a CI user. Never grant a CI
  identity `delete` or admin. Map this to OIDC-federated CI where the registry trusts the CI
  provider's tokens (no stored registry password — cross-ref rules/01 / rules/02 for the OIDC
  publish pattern).
- **Humans do not push to release repos.** CI is the only writer to anything promoted; that is
  what makes provenance meaningful (rules/02). Human push to a `dev/**` sandbox is fine.

## 8.3 Image integrity & immutability — defeating tag mutation

The attack: a tag like `app:prod` or `app:v1.2.3` is a *pointer*. If the registry lets it be
re-pushed, an attacker (or a careless human) repoints it to a different manifest and every
subsequent pull gets new bytes. Signed-by-CI provenance is worthless if the consumer trusts the
mutable pointer instead of the digest.

- **Enable tag immutability** where the registry supports it:
  - **Harbor**: tag immutability rules — an immutable tag cannot be deleted, re-pushed,
    re-tagged, or overwritten by replication (verified, goharbor.io). Scope rules to release tag
    patterns.
  - **ECR**: per-repository `imageTagMutability: IMMUTABLE` — a second push of an existing tag is
    rejected (verified, AWS docs).
  - **GAR**: immutable-tags setting is GA for Docker repositories — locks the digest a tag points
    to (verified, Google docs).
  - **ACR**: there is **no registry-wide immutable-tag toggle**; immutability is achieved by
    *locking* an image/repo (`az acr repository update --write-enabled false`) per artifact —
    treat ACR tag-immutability as a manual/automated lock step, not a built-in policy (verify
    current; Microsoft has had this as an open feature request).
  - **Zot**: enforce immutability at the consumer (digest pinning) + retention/policy; Zot does
    not ship a Harbor-style immutable-tag rule engine — do not assume one.
- **Consumers pin by digest.** Deploy manifests reference `image@sha256:...`, not tags (this is
  the build-once-promote-many invariant from rules/04 §4.5 and is *enforced* at admission by
  sota-kubernetes). A digest is content-addressed: it cannot be mutated under you. Tags are for
  humans; digests are the identity.
- **Signature + attestation storage and verification.** rules/02 produces cosign signatures and
  in-toto attestations; the registry **stores** them. Modern registries use the **OCI 1.1
  Referrers API** (`subject` + `artifactType`) to associate signatures/SBOMs/scan results with an
  image by digest — verified GA-track: OCI image+distribution v1.1 released; ECR, Quay, JFrog,
  GAR-class registries support the Referrers API; cosign/oras query it. Confirm your registry
  serves `/v2/<name>/referrers/<digest>` (older registries fall back to the tag-schema workaround
  — verify, because a registry that silently drops referrers loses your attestations). The
  *verify-and-enforce* step (admission requires a valid signature by your release identity) is in
  sota-kubernetes; the registry's job is to durably keep the referrer artifacts next to the image.
- **Content-trust legacy**: Harbor's old Notary/DCT path is superseded by **cosign**-based
  signing; treat new Notary v1/DCT setups as deprecated and standardize on cosign (rules/02).

## 8.4 Vulnerability management at the registry

The registry is the natural place to scan *what you actually store* and to re-scan against new
advisories without rebuilding. This complements (does not replace) CI scan-on-build (rules/04
§4.4) and the dependency posture in rules/03/05.

- **Scan-on-push, block-on-critical.** Configure the registry (or an attached scanner) to scan
  every pushed manifest and quarantine/fail images over policy:
  - **Harbor**: built-in Trivy scanning + a **"Prevent vulnerable images from running"** project
    policy (block pull above a severity) — this is the registry refusing to *serve* a failing
    image, a control admission cannot give you for non-cluster pullers.
  - **ECR**: enhanced scanning via **Amazon Inspector** — scan-on-push **and continuous re-scan**
    as new CVEs publish, covering OS + language packages and distroless/Chainguard/scratch bases
    (verified, AWS). Basic scanning is Clair-based.
  - **GAR**: Artifact Analysis on-push + continuous scanning across OS and language ecosystems
    (verified, Google). **ACR**: Microsoft Defender for Cloud scans at the **manifest** level on
    push/import/recent-pull (verified) — note untagged manifests still alert.
  - **Zot**: integrates Trivy for scan results surfaced in the API/UI; for hard *block-on-pull*,
    pair with admission enforcement (sota-kubernetes) since Zot is OCI-native and minimal.
- **Continuous re-scan is the point.** An image clean at push is not clean forever — a CVE
  disclosed next week applies to images already stored. Registry-side continuous scanning catches
  the "old image, new advisory" gap that build-time scanning structurally cannot. Reference the
  scheduled deployed-digest scan in rules/04 §4.4 / rules/03 — the registry continuous scan and
  the cluster deployed-digest scan are complementary (registry = what you store, cluster = what
  you run).
- **Store SBOM + scan attestations** next to the image (OCI referrers, §8.3) so the scan result
  and bill of materials travel with the artifact and feed admission policy ("scanned within N
  days" — rules/02 §2.4).
- **Quarantine, do not silently serve.** A failing image should be unpullable for prod (Harbor
  prevent-vulnerable policy, or a `quarantine/**` repo that admission rejects) — not merely
  flagged in a dashboard nobody reads. A scan with no enforcement is Medium decorative control.

## 8.5 Supply-chain pull hygiene

What the registry *pulls from upstream* is as much an attack surface as what it serves.

- **Pull-through cache / proxy for upstream images.** Front Docker Hub / public registries with a
  caching proxy (Zot **sync** in on-demand/mirror mode; Harbor proxy-cache projects; ECR
  pull-through cache; ACR artifact cache; GAR remote repos — all verified-current). Wins:
  - defeats Docker Hub rate limits (a real outage cause when forty nodes pull directly);
  - one audited choke point and one place to patch/scan upstream images;
  - availability: upstream outage does not stop your deploys.
- **Dependency confusion at the image layer.** Internal namespaces must not be shadowable by
  public ones. If you pull `mycorp/base` and a proxy can resolve that from Docker Hub's
  `mycorp/base`, an attacker who registers the public name owns your base image. Pin internal
  images to **your** registry by full path + digest; never let a proxy silently fall through to
  public for internal-looking names. (Same class as package dependency-confusion in rules/03 §3.2,
  applied to images.)
- **Allowed-registries policy.** Workloads pull only from your registry / blessed mirrors. This
  is **enforced at admission** by **sota-kubernetes** (registry allowlist) — reference it; do not
  duplicate the policy here. The registry-side half is: make your registry the only one that has
  what prod needs, so the allowlist is enforceable without breaking deploys.
- **Mirroring / air-gap.** For air-gapped or sovereignty-constrained environments, mirror the
  full dependency closure (bases, sidecars, operators) into your registry and cut external pull
  paths entirely — the allowlist then has nowhere else to go.

## 8.6 Retention, GC & availability — without breaking running deploys

- **Tag retention + garbage collection.** Expire dev/PR images on a schedule; GC unreferenced
  blobs to reclaim storage. Harbor v2.15 added tag-deletion options in GC (verified-current).
- **Never GC a digest a running workload references.** Deploys pin digests (§8.3); a retention
  rule that deletes by tag-age can orphan a digest that prod still runs, and the next node that
  cold-pulls it gets `manifest unknown` → `ImagePullBackOff`. Retention must exclude:
  digests referenced by live deployments (query deployed digests — rules/02 §2.8 / rules/04 §4.3),
  release artifacts within your audit horizon, and their attestations/SBOMs.
- **Run GC against a consistent view.** GC + concurrent push race on some registries — run GC in
  the registry's supported maintenance mode (Harbor handles locking; Zot GC has documented
  settings) rather than ad-hoc blob deletion.
- **HA + backup — it is tier-0.** The registry must survive node loss (HA replicas, replicated or
  object-store backend) and be **restorable** (backup the metadata DB *and* blob store together;
  test the restore). A registry that is the single copy of your release artifacts with no tested
  restore is a High availability/recovery finding. Harbor replication (to another Harbor, Docker
  Hub, ECR/GAR/ACR, any OCI registry — verified) and Zot sync give you a warm second copy.

## 8.7 Network & deployment hardening of the registry

- **Never anonymous + internet-exposed.** This is a continuously-scanned exposure class:
  registries on `0.0.0.0:5000` with auth off are found and abused at internet scale. Bind to
  loopback/cluster-internal, put authn in front, and restrict reachability — network policy /
  segmentation lives in **sota-network-security**; reference it. Internet-exposed + anonymous =
  Critical.
- **No `hostNetwork` unless genuinely required.** The finding ran the registry on a `hostNetwork`
  port, which both exposed it broadly and bypassed namespace network policy. Run it as a normal
  pod with a `ClusterIP`/internal Service; placement and pod hardening are **sota-kubernetes**;
  workload isolation (drop caps, read-only rootfs, non-root) is **sota-sandboxing**.
- **TLS always.** Even internal: registry creds and bearer tokens cross the wire on every push;
  plaintext registry traffic is credential interception. Terminate TLS at the registry or a
  trusted mesh sidecar; do not rely on `--insecure-registry` in clients (it disables verification
  fleet-wide and normalizes MITM).
- **Treat the registry config as security-critical material.** The commented-out accessControl
  mount is the canonical failure. Render config from a reviewed source (GitOps), validate it on
  deploy (fail startup if `accessControl`/`auth` is absent in a non-public registry), and alert if
  the running config permits anonymous write.

## 8.8 Product notes (brief — verify current at use)

- **Zot** (user's choice; current line **v2.1.x**, e.g. v2.1.14 Jan 2026): OCI-native, minimal,
  no DB. `accessControl` with `repositories`/`anonymousPolicy`/`defaultPolicy`/`policies`/
  `adminPolicy`; OIDC/LDAP/bearer/mTLS auth; workload-identity OIDC for secretless CI; **sync**
  for pull-through/mirror (incl. ECR upstream). It does **not** ship Harbor-style immutable-tag
  rules or block-on-pull scanning gates — get those from digest pinning + admission
  (sota-kubernetes). Verified against zotregistry.dev.
- **Harbor** (current **v2.15.x**, Mar 2026): projects + robot accounts + RBAC; **tag
  immutability rules**; built-in **Trivy** scan + prevent-vulnerable-from-running policy;
  **replication** to any OCI registry; cosign signing (Notary/DCT legacy). Heavier (Postgres,
  Redis, multiple services) — its HA/backup story is real work. Verified against goharbor.io.
- **Cloud registries** — IAM-scoped (no separate registry passwords), each with immutable tags +
  scan-on-push:
  - **ECR**: `IMMUTABLE` tags; Inspector enhanced scanning (on-push + continuous); managed image
    signing; pull-through cache. IAM/repo policies for access.
  - **GAR**: immutable-tags GA; Artifact Analysis scanning; IAM-scoped; remote/virtual repos.
  - **ACR**: image-lock for immutability (no registry-wide toggle — verify); Defender for Cloud
    scanning (manifest-level); artifact cache; RBAC/AAD.
  - **GHCR / Docker Hub**: GHCR ties access to the source repo (`image.source` label, rules/04
    §4.2.2) and supports OIDC-published provenance; Docker Hub's main risk is rate limits + the
    blast radius of being everyone's default upstream — front it with a pull-through cache (§8.5).

## Audit checklist

Hunt patterns in brackets.

- [ ] **No anonymous push**, and no anonymous pull on any instance holding private images
  [grep config for `anonymousPolicy` non-empty / missing auth; commented-out `accessControl`/auth
  mount; `0.0.0.0` bind with no `auth` block]
- [ ] Auth is OIDC/token/mTLS, not bare htpasswd; CI/robot accounts are **per-repo, expiring,
  non-admin**; push and pull identities are separate [shared read-write cred used by nodes and CI]
- [ ] Humans cannot push to release/promoted repos; CI is the sole writer there
- [ ] **Immutable tags** enabled where supported (Harbor rules / ECR `IMMUTABLE` / GAR setting /
  ACR lock); release tags are not re-pushable [try re-pushing an existing release tag in staging]
- [ ] Consumers **pin digests**, not tags (enforced at admission by sota-kubernetes)
  [`:latest` or bare mutable tags in deploy manifests]
- [ ] Signatures/SBOM/scan **attestations stored** with the image via OCI referrers, and a named
  verifier exists (rules/02 + sota-kubernetes) [signing present, zero verification]
- [ ] **Scan-on-push + continuous re-scan**; failing images quarantined/unpullable for prod, not
  just dashboarded [scanner enabled but no block/quarantine policy]
- [ ] Upstream pulls go through a **pull-through cache**; internal image names cannot fall through
  to public (image-layer dependency confusion); allowed-registries enforced (sota-kubernetes)
  [direct `docker.io/...` pulls in manifests; proxy fall-through for internal namespaces]
- [ ] Retention/GC **excludes digests referenced by running workloads** + release artifacts +
  their attestations [tag-age GC with no live-digest exclusion → ImagePullBackOff risk]
- [ ] Registry is **HA + backed up + restore-tested**; treated as tier-0 [single copy of release
  artifacts, no tested restore]
- [ ] **Not internet-exposed while anonymous**; **TLS** on; no `--insecure-registry`; no
  `hostNetwork` unless required; reachability restricted (sota-network-security) and workload
  hardened (sota-sandboxing) [public IP + port 5000 + no auth; `hostNetwork: true`]
- [ ] Registry config rendered from reviewed source; startup **fails closed** if auth/accessControl
  is absent on a non-public registry [config drift between repo and running instance]
