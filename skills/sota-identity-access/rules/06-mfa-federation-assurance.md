# 06 — MFA, Passwordless, Federation Risk & Assurance

Scope: phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/passkeys/WebAuthn at the IdP), step-up / adaptive /
conditional access, Continuous Access Evaluation (CAEP / Shared Signals Framework),
push-bombing / MFA-fatigue defenses, B2B/B2C/social-login and account-linking risks, and
identity proofing / assurance levels (NIST SP 800-63-4 IAL/AAL/FAL).

This file owns the **IdP-side authentication strength and federation-risk posture**. The
*WebAuthn ceremony implementation* at one RP (challenge generation, attestation handling,
credential storage) is **sota-code-security** rules/02 — reference it for the wire-level
ceremony; here we own the policy and the assurance model.

## 1. Phishing-resistant MFA at the IdP

- **FIDO2 / WebAuthn / passkeys are the target state.** They are phishing-resistant:
  origin-bound (the credential only works for the registered relying-party origin),
  challenge-response, no shared secret to phish or replay. WebAuthn is at **Level 3**
  (W3C Candidate Recommendation as of early 2026 — current spec level, not yet a finished
  Recommendation).
- **Passkeys** = FIDO credentials, either device-bound (hardware security key, platform
  authenticator) or **synced** multi-device (synced through a provider's keychain). Synced
  passkeys trade some assurance for huge usability/recovery wins — for the highest
  assurance prefer device-bound/hardware authenticators.
- **MFA factor ranking** (use the strongest the population supports):
  1. FIDO2 hardware security key / device-bound passkey (phishing-resistant) — best.
  2. Synced passkey / platform authenticator (phishing-resistant).
  3. App-based push with number-matching (phishable but resists fatigue — §3).
  4. TOTP / authenticator-app codes (phishable via real-time relay).
  5. SMS / voice OTP — **not phishing-resistant** (SIM-swap, interception, relay). Treat
     as a Medium finding where phishing-resistant options are feasible; never the only
     factor for privileged accounts.
- **Require phishing-resistant MFA for all privileged accounts** (rules/05) and drive all
  users toward passkeys. Enroll passkeys at the IdP and let them satisfy MFA across all
  federated RPs via SSO.

## 2. Step-up, adaptive & conditional access

- **Step-up authentication**: low-risk actions ride the existing session; sensitive
  actions (change MFA, move money, export data, admin operations) demand a *fresh*
  strong authentication. Express the requirement as an assurance level (AAL) or ACR the
  RP requests and the IdP enforces (`acr_values` / `max_age` in the OIDC request).
- **Adaptive / conditional access**: gate authentication on context — device posture,
  network/location, impossible-travel, risk score. High risk → step-up or block; low risk
  → allow. Feed the risk signals from and to **sota-detection-engineering** (auth anomaly,
  impossible-travel detections).
- Conditional access is policy-as-code too: version it, test it, and fail closed (an
  unevaluated condition denies or steps up, never silently allows).

## 3. Push-bombing / MFA-fatigue defenses

The attacker has the password and spams push prompts until the user taps "approve":

- **Number matching** — the user types a number shown on the login screen into the app,
  so a blind "approve" cannot succeed.
- **Rate-limit and lock out** repeated push prompts; alert on push storms.
- **Show context** in the prompt (app, location, IP) so the user can spot the anomaly.
- The real fix is **phishing-resistant MFA** (§1), which has no "approve" to spam.

## 4. B2B / B2C / social-login & account-linking risk

- **Social / external login** delegates authentication to an upstream IdP. Validate its
  tokens fully (rules/01 §3), pin the issuer, and **only trust verified claims** (e.g.
  `email_verified=true`) — never link on an unverified email.
- **Account-linking attacks**: linking a federated identity to a local account on a
  *mutable* or *unverified* attribute lets an attacker pre-register or collide and take
  over. Link deterministically on a **verified, immutable** identifier (provider `sub` +
  verified email); require re-verification to link a second IdP to an existing account.
- **B2B federation**: each partner/tenant trust is a boundary (rules/02 §8). Re-map their
  group/role claims through your own authorization model (rules/03) — a partner IdP must
  not be able to assert your privileged roles.

## 5. Continuous Access Evaluation (CAEP / Shared Signals Framework)

Bearer tokens are valid until they expire, so a revocation/disable does not take effect
until the token times out — the gap that lets a just-fired employee keep working for the
token lifetime. CAEP/SSF closes it:

- **Shared Signals Framework (SSF) 1.0** is **final (29 August 2025)** at the OpenID
  Foundation — a transport framework for asynchronously delivering Security Event Tokens
  (SETs) between an IdP and RPs/receivers.
- **CAEP 1.0** is **final (29 August 2025)** — defines the event types carried over SSF,
  including **session-revoked, credential-change, assurance-level-change** (plus
  token-claims-change, device-compliance-change, session-established/presented,
  risk-level-change).
- Use it so that disabling an account, a credential change, or a risk-level rise **pushes
  a revocation event** to relying parties in near-real-time instead of waiting for token
  expiry. This is the propagation mechanism behind the leaver SLA (rules/04) and Single
  Logout (rules/02 §6). **RISC** is the parallel SSF profile for account-takeover/fraud
  signals.

## 6. Identity proofing & assurance levels (NIST SP 800-63-4)

**NIST SP 800-63-4 "Digital Identity Guidelines" is final (July 2025)**, superseding
Rev 3, across three volumes: 800-63A-4 (proofing), 800-63B-4 (authentication), 800-63C-4
(federation). The assurance model:

- **IAL — Identity Assurance Level**: confidence that the person is who they claim
  (identity proofing). IAL1→IAL2→IAL3 rising rigor.
- **AAL — Authenticator Assurance Level**: confidence in the authentication
  (authenticator strength + binding). AAL2 needs MFA; **AAL3 requires a hardware-based,
  phishing-resistant authenticator**.
- **FAL — Federation Assurance Level**: strength of the federated assertion (signing,
  encryption, holder-of-key binding). FAL rises with assertion protection.

Match the assurance level to the risk of the resource (don't demand IAL3 in-person
proofing to read a blog; do demand AAL3 for production infra). What 800-63-4 changed vs
Rev 3, reflect these:
- **Syncable authenticators (passkeys) are explicitly recognized** as an authenticator
  type.
- **No periodic password rotation** and no arbitrary composition rules — rotate passwords
  only on evidence of compromise (the app-side storage of those passwords is
  **sota-code-security** rules/02).
- Stronger emphasis on **phishing-resistant authenticators** for higher AAL / high-risk.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Is phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/passkey) available at the IdP and **required for all privileged accounts**?
- [ ] Is SMS/voice OTP relied on as a sole or primary factor anywhere it could be phishing-resistant instead?
- [ ] Are users actively driven toward passkeys, with enrollment at the IdP satisfying MFA across federated RPs?
- [ ] Do sensitive operations require step-up (fresh strong auth via `acr_values`/`max_age`), not just an existing session?
- [ ] Is conditional/adaptive access policy versioned, tested, and fail-closed?
- [ ] Are push-MFA prompts protected with number-matching, rate limiting, context display, and storm alerting?
- [ ] Does social/external login trust only verified immutable claims, with the upstream issuer pinned and tokens fully validated?
- [ ] Is account linking done on a verified immutable id, with re-verification to add a second IdP (no linking on mutable/unverified email)?
- [ ] Are B2B partner group/role claims re-mapped through the local authorization model, never trusted to grant privileged roles?
- [ ] Is CAEP/SSF (or an equivalent) wired so disable/credential-change/risk events propagate revocation to RPs in near-real-time, not at token expiry?
- [ ] Are IAL/AAL/FAL levels chosen to match resource risk, with AAL3 (hardware phishing-resistant) for the highest-risk access?
- [ ] Is password policy 800-63-4-aligned (no forced periodic rotation, no composition rules; rotate on compromise only)?
