# 04 — Risk Rating & Treatment

Rating exists to ORDER work and justify dispositions — not to produce
precise-looking numbers. Prefer a coarse, calibrated, contextual scale applied
consistently over a fine-grained scale applied inconsistently.

## 1. DREAD — know it, and know why not to trust it

DREAD scores Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users,
Discoverability (1–10 each, averaged). Pitfalls — each one disqualifying for
serious use:

1. **Unanchored scales.** "Damage = 7" means different things to different
   raters; scores drift by who's in the room. (Microsoft itself dropped DREAD
   for this.)
2. **Averaging hides extremes.** Damage 10 / everything-else 2 averages to a
   "low" — but a hard-to-find RCE is still an RCE. Worst-dimension logic
   beats means.
3. **Discoverability rewards obscurity.** Rating threats lower because
   "nobody will find it" institutionalizes security-by-obscurity; attackers
   read code, run scanners, and get lucky. If you keep D, score it 10 always —
   at which point drop it.
4. **Double counting.** Reproducibility, Exploitability, Discoverability are
   three blurry views of likelihood; one inflated dimension skews the total.

If an org mandates DREAD: anchor every level with written exemplars, replace
the mean with max-of(Damage, weakest-link likelihood), and fix D=10. At that
point you have rebuilt likelihood × impact — use that directly (§3).

## 2. CVSS — what it's for and how to use it without lying

CVSS scores **vulnerability severity characteristics**, not your risk. Base
score assumes a "reasonable worst case" deployment that is not yours.

Rules:
- **Use CVSS for vulnerabilities (CVEs, pentest findings), not design-stage
  threats.** Threats from a model lack the concrete exploit parameters CVSS
  vectors encode; scoring hypotheticals produces false precision.
- **Never rank by base score alone.** Adjust with environmental/threat
  metrics — or informally: Is the vulnerable path reachable here? Authn in
  front? Exploit public? Asset behind it valuable? A 9.8 in a dev-only,
  network-isolated tool can be Medium; a 6.5 authz bypass on the payment API
  is Critical.
- **Record the vector string, not just the number** (e.g.
  `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`) so reviewers can audit the
  assumptions — the vector is the rating; the number is a summary.
- **CVSS ≠ exploitation probability.** For "will this actually be exploited",
  consult exploit-prediction signals (EPSS-class scores, KEV-style
  known-exploited lists) and your own exposure; severity and likelihood are
  separate axes.

## 3. Likelihood × impact — the default rating method

Use a 3×3 (or at most 4×4) matrix with ANCHORED level definitions. Anchors are
the whole method; publish them with the model.

**Likelihood anchors** (calibrate to your exposure):

| Level | Anchor |
|---|---|
| High | Exploitable by an unauthenticated or any-customer actor with public techniques/tools; or attack is automated/commodity (credential stuffing, scanner-findable) |
| Medium | Needs a valid account, a specific misconfig, social engineering, or chaining two weaknesses; technique documented but targeted |
| Low | Needs insider access, physical access, significant novel research, or multiple independent failures |

**Impact anchors** (write per system, in business terms — PASTA-lite preamble
from `01` §4 feeds this):

| Level | Anchor (example for a payments SaaS) |
|---|---|
| High | Any-customer data breach; money movement; RCE in prod; full account takeover class |
| Medium | Single-account compromise; partial data exposure; sustained outage of a paid feature |
| Low | Cosmetic, single-user self-inflicted, info of negligible value |

**Matrix → priority:**

| | Impact Low | Impact Med | Impact High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Likelihood High** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Likelihood Med** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Likelihood Low** | Low | Low | Medium* |

\* Escalate Low×High to High when the impact is catastrophic-irreversible
(safety, signing-key theft) — fat tails don't average.

Rules:
- **Rate the threat AS MITIGATED TODAY,** then optionally note inherent (un-
  mitigated) risk. Ranking inherent risk floods the top band uselessly.
- **Likelihood follows the easiest path** to the impact, not the path you
  enumerated first. Attack trees (`01` §5) find the cheapest branch.
- **Don't multiply made-up numbers.** 1–5 scales multiplied give 1–25
  pseudo-precision; band labels resist abuse better. For real quantification
  use a FAIR-style analysis with ranges — only worth it for top-5 enterprise
  risks.
- **Calibrate across raters:** score 5 threats independently, compare, refine
  anchors where raters diverged. Re-calibrate when the team changes.

Severity-label conventions for audit findings are defined in `SKILL.md` and
elaborated in `06` — same axes, evidence-backed.

## 4. Treatment: accept / mitigate / transfer / avoid

Every threat gets exactly one disposition, recorded with the threat. "Noted"
or an unassigned ticket is not a disposition.

| Treatment | Use when | Required record |
|---|---|---|
| **Mitigate** | Control is cheaper than expected loss; default for High+ | Requirement ID(s) + owner + verification test (§5) |
| **Accept** | Residual risk below appetite; cost of control exceeds it | Named individual owner (a person with authority over the asset, not "the team"), rationale, expiry/review date. Un-expiring acceptances are how risk registers rot. |
| **Transfer** | Liability shiftable: insurance, payment processor, managed service | Contract/SLA reference + the residual you keep (reputation never transfers; breach-response duties rarely do) |
| **Avoid** | Feature/design not worth its risk | Design change record — e.g., don't store PANs at all (use a token vault), drop the "fetch any URL" feature, remove the agent's write-tools |

Rules:
- **Avoid is underused.** Always ask "can we not have this data/feature/
  privilege?" before designing a mitigation — deleted attack surface needs no
  patching. Data minimization is risk avoidance (and LINDDUN Dd treatment).
- **Mitigations can change likelihood OR impact — say which.** Rate limiting
  cuts likelihood; encryption + tokenization cut impact; segmentation cuts
  blast radius. Prefer one impact-cutting control plus one likelihood-cutting
  control on Critical paths (defense in depth, but bounded — two layers,
  justified, not five vague ones).
- **Acceptance escalates with severity:** Low — tech lead; Medium —
  eng manager; High — director/CISO; Critical — not acceptable without
  executive sign-off and a dated remediation plan.

## 5. Mapping mitigations to requirements and tests

A mitigation that is not a requirement will not be built; a requirement that
is not a test will not survive refactoring.

**Chain:** threat → requirement → implementation → verification. Keep IDs
linked end to end:

```
T-012  (High) Authenticated customer reads other tenants' orders via
       GET /orders/{id} (IDOR; STRIDE-E/I)
SR-104 Every order access MUST verify order.tenant_id == caller.tenant_id
       at the data-access layer (not per-handler).
IMPL   OrderRepository.get() takes tenant from auth context; handlers
       cannot pass tenant explicitly. (PR #482)
VER-1  Integration test: tenant-A token + tenant-B order id → 404.   [abuse case]
VER-2  Static check: CI greps for OrderRepository bypass / raw order
       queries outside the repository module.                        [regression guard]
```

Rules:
- **Write requirements as testable MUSTs** with a location ("at the
  data-access layer"), not aspirations ("handle authz properly"). One
  requirement may cover many threats; never the reverse without splitting.
- **Every mitigated High+ threat gets a VER entry** — an abuse-case test
  (negative test from the attacker's perspective, see `05` §3) and, where
  possible, a structural guard (lint rule, policy-as-code, dependency rule)
  that fails CI on regression.
- **Requirements live in the backlog with normal tracking** (see `05` §2) —
  a threat model PDF with embedded TODOs is a graveyard.

## 6. Residual risk documentation

After treatment, what risk remains — because controls are partial, accepted,
or transferred-with-remainder? Document per threat, one line:

```
T-012 residual: tenant check enforced in repository layer; raw-SQL
escape hatches remain in /reports module (compensated by VER-2 grep,
reviewed quarterly). Residual rating: Low. Owner: j.doe. Review: 2026-09.
```

Rules:
- **Residual rating uses the same L×I matrix** — re-rate after controls, don't
  hand-wave "lower".
- **Aggregate residuals roll up to a risk register** (one table: threat ID,
  residual rating, owner, review date) — this is the artifact leadership
  actually reads; keep it under a page.
- **An expired review date flips the acceptance to a finding** in audits
  (`06`). Build the expiry sweep into the living-model cadence (`05` §4).

## 7. Rating anti-patterns (rejected on sight in review)

- **Severity haggling by remediation cost.** "Let's call it Medium because the
  fix is hard" — cost belongs in the treatment decision (maybe you accept or
  phase it), never in the rating. Once cost leaks into severity, the register
  stops describing reality.
- **Best-case likelihood.** Rating "Low because our WAF probably blocks it" —
  rate against the easiest path WITH evidence of the control; "probably" means
  the control is Partial and the rating stands.
- **Impact capped at the component.** "Only the worker is compromised" —
  impact follows the privilege-reach map (`02` §8), not the initially-popped
  box. A worker with DB write is a database compromise.
- **Stale ratings after architecture change.** L×I was assigned when the
  service was internal; it's public now. Re-rating is part of every re-model
  trigger (`05` §4), not a separate ceremony.
- **One number for a threat class.** "XSS: High" — each instance rates on its
  own context (what the page can reach, who views it). Classes get thematic
  findings (`06` §4); instances get ratings.
- **Risk-appetite fog.** Accept/mitigate thresholds undefined, so every
  dispute is relitigated. Write the appetite line once ("we mitigate all
  High+, accept Medium with director sign-off, batch Lows quarterly") and
  point at it.
- **Probability theater.** "0.3 likelihood × $2.4M = $720k expected loss"
  built on gut numbers. Either do the FAIR-style estimation with calibrated
  ranges and document the basis, or keep honest bands.

## Worked micro-example — rating in context

Same vulnerability, two ratings, both correct:

- *Unauthenticated SSRF in PDF renderer; renderer pod has IMDSv2 enforced,
  egress-deny netpol, no cloud role.* Likelihood High, Impact Low (reaches
  nothing) → **Medium**, mitigate via URL allowlist; accept residual Low.
- *Same SSRF; pod runs with node's instance role, flat VPC.* Likelihood High,
  Impact High (metadata creds → account) → **Critical**: fix the egress/IMDS
  posture (impact cut) AND the SSRF (likelihood cut); nothing acceptable here.

The CVE/base score would be identical for both. Context is the rating.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] A single, anchored rating scheme is defined and used consistently;
      anchors written down, not folklore.
- [ ] No raw DREAD means or unadjusted CVSS base scores used as priority;
      CVSS vectors recorded where CVSS is used.
- [ ] Threats rated as-mitigated, with likelihood reflecting the easiest
      path; Low×catastrophic escalated, not averaged away.
- [ ] Every threat has exactly one disposition: mitigate/accept/transfer/
      avoid; no "noted"/orphaned threats.
- [ ] Acceptances have a named individual owner, rationale, and unexpired
      review date; acceptance authority matches severity.
- [ ] "Avoid" considered (data/feature/privilege removal) before expensive
      mitigations — evidence in at least one disposition.
- [ ] Threat→requirement→test ID chain intact for all High+ mitigations;
      abuse-case tests exist and run in CI.
- [ ] Residual risks re-rated on the same scale and rolled into a ≤1-page
      register with owners and review dates.
- [ ] Expired acceptances/reviews flagged as findings.
