  State-of-the-art threat modeling for both designing new systems and auditing
  existing ones. Use when designing a feature, service, integration, or
  architecture that touches untrusted input, new trust boundaries, sensitive
  data, or third-party dependencies (BUILD mode), and when reviewing, auditing,
  or pen-test-scoping an existing codebase to reconstruct its implicit threat
  model and find gaps (AUDIT mode). Trigger keywords: threat model, STRIDE,

# SOTA Threat Modeling

## Purpose

Threat modeling answers Shostack's four questions with engineering rigor:
1. **What are we working on?** (decompose: DFD, trust boundaries, assets, actors)
2. **What can go wrong?** (enumerate: STRIDE/LINDDUN per element, catalogs, attack trees)
3. **What are we going to do about it?** (treat: mitigate/accept/transfer/avoid, map to requirements and tests)
4. **Did we do a good job?** (verify: abuse-case tests, residual risk review, re-model triggers)

This skill operationalizes those questions in two modes. Never produce a threat
model that is only prose — every threat must land as a tracked requirement, a
test, or an explicitly accepted risk with an owner.

## BUILD Mode — Threat-Model-While-Designing

Run this workflow whenever designing anything that crosses a trust boundary.
Scale effort to risk: a 15-minute "four questions" pass for a small feature; a
full STRIDE-per-interaction model for a new service or auth flow.

### Workflow

1. **Scope the delta.** Model what is new or changed, not the whole system.
   List new entry points, new data classes, new dependencies, new actors.
2. **Draw the DFD as text/mermaid** (see `rules/02`). Mark trust boundaries
   explicitly. If you cannot draw a boundary, you do not understand the design
   yet — stop and ask.
3. **Pick the methodology** (see `rules/01`): STRIDE-per-interaction by
   default; add LINDDUN if personal data flows; attack trees for a single
   high-value asset; four-questions-only for low-risk deltas.
4. **Enumerate threats** crossing each boundary using the per-component
   catalogs in `rules/03`. Write each threat as: *actor → action → asset →
   impact*. No vague entries ("hacking", "data breach").
5. **Rate and treat** each threat (see `rules/04`): likelihood × impact matrix,
   then accept / mitigate / transfer / avoid. Every mitigation becomes a
   security requirement with an ID.
6. **Emit artifacts** (see `rules/05`): threat model doc, security requirements
   backlog entries, abuse cases as test stubs, and re-modeling triggers.
7. **Wire into delivery.** Reference requirement IDs in the design doc, tickets,
   and PR descriptions. A threat without a tracked artifact does not exist.

### Continuous / incremental (agile, PR reviews)

- Threat model the **story**, not the sprint. Add a "Security notes" section to
  design docs and PR descriptions for any change matching a re-model trigger:
  new dependency, new endpoint/route/queue/cron/webhook, new trust boundary,
  new data class, auth/authz change, file/deserialization handling.
- In PR review, run a micro-STRIDE on the diff only: what new input enters?
  whose privilege executes it? what does it write or call? Takes 5 minutes;
  catches the majority of design-level regressions.

## AUDIT Mode — Reconstructing a Threat Model from Code

Use when handed an existing system with no (trustworthy) threat model. Goal:
rebuild the implicit model from artifacts, then diff intended vs. actual
controls. Full procedure in `rules/06`.

### Workflow

1. **Inventory entry points from code** (see `rules/02` §extraction): routes,
   queue consumers, cron jobs, webhooks, third-party callbacks, CLI/admin
   tools, file uploads, IaC-exposed ports.
2. **Reconstruct the DFD** from the inventory: processes, stores, external
   entities, flows; infer trust boundaries from network topology, authn
   checkpoints, and IAM policies.
3. **Identify assets and actors** from schemas, secrets handling, and config.
4. **Run the catalogs** (`rules/03`) against each component; for every catalog
   item record: control present / absent / partial, with file:line evidence.
5. **Gap analysis**: rank absent/partial controls by exploitability ×
   blast radius; distinguish "missing control" from "missing defense-in-depth".
6. **Report findings** in the standard format below.

### Severity conventions

| Severity | Definition |
|---|---|
| Critical | Remotely exploitable now, by an unauthenticated or low-priv actor, leading to full compromise of a key asset (RCE, auth bypass, mass data exfil). Fix before anything else ships. |
| High | Exploitable with realistic preconditions (one valid account, one misconfig, MitM position) compromising a key asset; or a Critical with a single weak mitigating layer. Fix this sprint. |
| Medium | Requires chaining, elevated access, or unusual conditions; or impacts a secondary asset; or defense-in-depth gap on a Critical path. Schedule. |
| Low | Hardening, hygiene, info disclosure of low-value data, theoretical with strong existing controls. Backlog. |

Severity = exploitability × impact in **this** deployment context — never copy
a CVE/CVSS base score without environmental adjustment (see `rules/04`).

### Finding format (every finding, no exceptions)

```
[SEV] TITLE (component, STRIDE/LINDDUN class)
Location: path/to/file.py:123 (and IaC/config refs)
Threat: <actor> can <action> via <vector> because <missing/weak control>,
        impacting <asset> (<C/I/A/privacy impact>).
Evidence: code excerpt or config line proving the gap.
Recommendation: specific control + where it goes; map to requirement ID.
Residual risk if accepted: one sentence.
```

Load only the files you need; `rules/02` + `rules/03` cover 80% of day-to-day work.

## Top-10 Non-Negotiables

1. **No model without a diagram.** Every threat model includes a DFD (mermaid
   or ASCII) with explicit trust boundaries. Prose-only models hide boundary
   confusion.
2. **Threats are sentences, not nouns.** *Actor → action → asset → impact.*
   "SQL injection" is a vector; "anonymous user exfiltrates the orders table
   via unparameterized search query" is a threat.
3. **Every entry point gets enumerated** — including queues, cron, webhooks,
   callbacks, admin tooling, and CI/CD. HTTP routes are never the whole attack
   surface.
4. **Trust boundary crossings drive enumeration.** Apply STRIDE per
   interaction at each crossing; data inside one boundary at one privilege
   level rarely needs the full treatment.
5. **Personal data ⇒ LINDDUN pass.** STRIDE does not cover linkability,
   identifiability, or non-compliance; run a privacy pass whenever PII flows
   or is stored.
6. **Rate with likelihood × impact in context.** Never ship raw DREAD scores
   or unadjusted CVSS base scores as priorities.
7. **Every threat gets a disposition.** Mitigate (→ requirement ID + test),
   accept (→ named owner + expiry date), transfer, or avoid. "Noted" is not a
   disposition.
8. **Mitigations become tests.** Each mitigated threat yields at least one
   abuse-case test (unit, integration, or rule-based check) that fails if the
   control regresses.
9. **LLM/agent components are first-class attack surface.** Model prompt
   injection, tool-call abuse, excessive agency, and data exfil via outputs
   for any system invoking an LLM with tools or retrieved content.
10. **Models expire.** Define re-model triggers (new dependency, new trust
    boundary, new data class, auth change) in the document itself; an undated,
    trigger-less threat model is treated as absent in audits.
