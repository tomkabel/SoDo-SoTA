# 06 — Webhooks

Scope: both roles — **provider** (you deliver webhooks to user-supplied URLs) and
**consumer** (you receive them). Signing, replay protection, retries, ordering,
idempotent consumption, SSRF defense.

## 1. Payload & contract design

- Webhook = event notification, same schema discipline as the API: versioned event
  types (`invoice.paid`), documented JSON schema, additive evolution (rules/02).
- Envelope every event:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_01HZX4K7",            // globally unique — consumer dedupe key
  "type": "invoice.paid",
  "created_at": "2026-06-12T09:30:00Z",
  "api_version": "2026-06-01",
  "data": { "object": { ... } }
}
```

- **Thin vs fat payloads**: fat (full object) is convenient but delivers stale
  state out of order and leaks data through the consumer's logs/infra. **Thin
  payloads (ID + type, consumer fetches current state via API)** are the safer
  default for sensitive domains and neutralize most ordering pain (§5). Offer fat
  payloads only where the fetch round-trip genuinely hurts.
- Never put secrets/PII you wouldn't put in an email into a fat payload — you do
  not control the receiving infrastructure.
- Let users subscribe per event type; don't firehose everything to every endpoint.

## 2. Signing — HMAC with timestamp

Unsigned webhooks are unauthenticated POSTs from the internet; any auditor flags
them instantly.

**Provider:**
- Sign `id + "." + timestamp + "." + raw_body` with HMAC-SHA256 using a per-endpoint
  secret (the Standard Webhooks signed-content format). Send id + timestamp +
  signature in headers. The **Standard Webhooks** spec is the 2026 convention —
  adopt it instead of inventing:

```http
POST /hooks/billing HTTP/1.1
webhook-id: evt_01HZX4K7
webhook-timestamp: 1781256600
webhook-signature: v1,K5oZfzN95Z9UVu1EsfQmfVNQhnkZ2pj9o9NDN/H/pI4=
```

- Sign the **raw bytes** you send. Include the timestamp **inside** the signed
  string (binds it — attacker can't re-send old body with fresh timestamp).
- Version-prefix signatures (`v1,`) and support **multiple signatures per
  delivery** — that's what makes zero-downtime secret rotation possible (sign with
  old+new during overlap; consumers verify against any of their stored secrets).
- Per-endpoint secrets (one compromised consumer ≠ all), shown once at creation,
  rotatable via API/dashboard.
- mTLS or OAuth-to-consumer are heavier alternatives for enterprise consumers;
  HMAC remains the baseline everyone must have.

**Consumer verification — the order matters:**
1. Read the **raw body bytes** (before any JSON parsing/middleware re-serialization
   — re-serialized JSON ≠ signed bytes; the most common "signature randomly fails"
   bug).
2. Check timestamp within tolerance (±5 min) → otherwise reject (replay window).
3. Compute HMAC, compare with **constant-time comparison** (`hmac.compare_digest`,
   `crypto.timingSafeEqual`) — `==` on signatures is a timing-oracle finding.
4. Only then parse and process.
- Also verify the event is *for you* (right endpoint/tenant) if the provider
  multiplexes.

Reference consumer verification (Python; pattern is language-agnostic):

```python
# BAD — three findings in four lines
body = request.json()                              # parsed before verification
expected = hmac_sha256(secret, json.dumps(body))   # re-serialized != signed bytes
if request.headers["X-Sig"] == expected: ...       # timing-unsafe ==; no timestamp check

# GOOD
raw = request.raw_body()                                   # exact bytes
ts = int(request.headers["webhook-timestamp"])
if abs(time.time() - ts) > 300: raise Reject(400)          # replay window
msg = f"{request.headers['webhook-id']}.{ts}.".encode() + raw
for secret in active_secrets:                              # rotation: try all
    digest = hmac.new(secret, msg, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    for sig in parse_v1_signatures(request.headers["webhook-signature"]):
        if hmac.compare_digest(digest, sig):               # constant-time
            return process(json.loads(raw))
raise Reject(401)
```

## 3. Replay protection

Signature alone doesn't stop re-delivery of a *validly signed* old request
(captured by a proxy, leaked from logs).

- Timestamp tolerance (§2) bounds the window.
- Within the window: **dedupe on `webhook-id`/event `id`** — store processed IDs
  with TTL ≥ tolerance window (and ideally ≥ provider's max retry horizon);
  reject/no-op duplicates. This doubles as idempotency (§4) — one mechanism, two
  jobs.
- Providers: never reuse event IDs, even across retries of the same event
  (same id on retry — that's the point), and rotate-don't-share secrets.

## 4. Delivery, retries & idempotent consumers

**Provider:**
- Deliveries come from a **queue with persistent state**, never inline in the
  request path that generated the event (use outbox pattern: event row committed
  in the same transaction as the domain change, dispatcher drains it — otherwise
  you emit webhooks for rolled-back transactions or drop events on crash).
- Success = any 2xx within a short timeout (5–10s total, no following redirects —
  §8). Everything else (timeout, 4xx except 410, 5xx) ⇒ retry with **exponential
  backoff + jitter** over hours-to-days (e.g. 1m, 5m, 30m, 2h, 5h, 10h, 24h…
  ~3 days like Stripe).
- `410 Gone` from consumer ⇒ auto-disable the endpoint. Persistent failures
  (e.g. >95% over 3 days) ⇒ disable + notify the owner. Track per-endpoint health.
- Expose to consumers: delivery logs, manual redelivery button/API, and a
  **reconciliation API** (`GET /events?after=...`) so consumers can backfill
  gaps — webhooks are at-least-once-ish, never guaranteed; the events API is the
  source of truth.
- Don't let one dead endpoint block others: per-endpoint queues/concurrency
  isolation.

**Consumer:**
- **Ack fast, process async**: verify signature → enqueue → return `2xx` in
  <1s. Doing real work inline ⇒ provider timeout ⇒ retry storm ⇒ duplicate
  processing of slow work. Return 5xx only when you failed to durably enqueue.
- **Idempotency is mandatory** — retries guarantee duplicates. Dedupe on event
  `id` (unique constraint in DB beats best-effort cache), and make handlers safe
  to re-run anyway (upserts, state-machine guards).
- Don't trust webhook *content* for money-moving decisions when thin-fetch is
  available: signature proves origin, but fetching current state by ID closes
  staleness/ordering gaps.

Provider dispatch architecture (reference shape):

```text
domain tx ──commit──> outbox row
outbox poller ──> event store (immutable events, powers GET /events)
             └─> per-endpoint delivery queues ──> sender workers
                                                  | resolve->validate IP->pin->POST
                                                  | record attempt (status, latency)
                                                  └─ on failure: schedule retry (backoff+jitter)
```

- The event store is canonical; delivery attempts reference it. Redelivery and
  reconciliation read from it — never regenerate payloads from live data (the
  object may have changed; signatures/audits must match what was sent).
- Sender workers are stateless and horizontally scalable; per-endpoint
  concurrency = 1..N with ordering *not* guaranteed (and documented as such, §5).
- Emit provider-side metrics per endpoint: success rate, P95 delivery latency,
  retry depth, disabled-endpoint count — this is your consumer-health dashboard.

## 5. Ordering caveats

**Webhooks are unordered. Period.** Retries, parallel dispatchers, and network
races mean `invoice.paid` can arrive before `invoice.created`. Providers should
not promise ordering (per-key serial delivery throttles throughput to the slowest
consumer and still breaks on retry).

Consumer strategies:
- Treat events as triggers, **fetch current state** by ID (thin-payload mindset)
  — ordering becomes irrelevant.
- Or compare `created_at`/sequence in the event against last-applied state and
  drop stale updates (last-writer-wins per object).
- Or buffer out-of-order events briefly (park `*.paid` until `*.created` is seen,
  with a timeout that falls back to fetching).
- Never build a state machine that errors on out-of-order arrivals — that's a
  design bug, not a provider bug.

## 6. Consumer-side endpoint hygiene

- Dedicated route, **no session/cookie auth required** but signature verification
  enforced; reject unsigned/badly signed with `401`, don't reveal verification
  details in error bodies.
- Enforce body size limit before reading fully; `415` non-JSON; rate-limit per
  source as backstop.
- Log every delivery (id, type, signature result, latency, outcome) — disputes
  with providers are settled with logs.
- Secrets in a secret manager, per provider, rotated when staff leave; support
  two active secrets to absorb provider rotation (§2).

## 7. Webhooks vs alternatives — when not to webhook

- Consumer needs *every* event, in order, with replay → give them an **events
  API to poll** (`GET /events?after=evt_x`, cursor-paginated) or a streaming
  channel; webhooks alone are a notification optimization on top of that, not a
  reliable transport.
- Very high volume to one consumer (>~100/s sustained) → batch events per
  delivery, or switch to a queue/stream integration (consumer-owned SQS/Kafka
  topic, Event Grid). Per-event HTTP POSTs don't scale linearly forever.
- Consumer is inside your own estate → use the message bus directly; webhooks
  through the public internet between your own services is an architecture smell.
- Zapier-style fan-in platforms: support thin payloads + reconciliation API and
  they'll integrate fine; don't build platform-specific hacks.

## 8. SSRF — provider delivering to user-supplied URLs

A webhook sender is **an HTTP client that attackers point anywhere** ("give me
your cloud metadata, please"). Egress controls are non-negotiable:

- **Validate at registration AND at every send** (DNS changes between the two —
  rebinding): resolve the hostname, reject private/reserved ranges —
  `10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 127/8, 169.254/16` (cloud metadata!), `::1`,
  `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms.
- **Pin the resolved IP for the actual connection** (resolve→check→connect to
  that IP with Host/SNI set) — checking then re-resolving is a TOCTOU rebinding
  hole.
- **Don't follow redirects** (or re-validate every hop — simpler: don't). A public
  URL 302→`http://169.254.169.254/` is the classic bypass.
- HTTPS-only endpoints (allow plain HTTP at most for explicit dev mode); modest
  timeouts; cap response bytes read (you only need the status); never include
  response bodies from consumer endpoints in your logs/UI unsanitized.
- Best: dispatch from an **isolated egress** (dedicated VPC/proxy with deny-all
  to internal ranges) so a validation bug still hits a wall.
- Prove ownership before sending real data to a new URL (challenge token echo /
  verification event) — stops using your webhook system to spam/probe third
  parties.
- Per-tenant send rate limits — your webhook sender must not be rentable DDoS
  infrastructure.

## Audit checklist

**Provider role:**
- [ ] HMAC-SHA256 over timestamp+raw body, versioned scheme, per-endpoint secrets, multi-signature rotation support (Standard Webhooks-compatible preferred).
- [ ] Outbox/queue-backed dispatch (no inline sends, no events from rolled-back transactions); per-endpoint isolation so one dead consumer can't starve others.
- [ ] Exponential backoff + jitter retries over days; 410 auto-disables; failing endpoints disabled with owner notification.
- [ ] Delivery logs, manual redelivery, and an events reconciliation API exposed to consumers.
- [ ] Event IDs unique and stable across retries; no ordering promised in docs.
- [ ] SSRF defenses: private/metadata IP ranges blocked with resolve-pin-connect (no TOCTOU), redirects not followed, HTTPS-only, response size cap, isolated egress, URL ownership verification, per-tenant send rate limits.
- [ ] No secrets/excess PII in payloads; thin payloads for sensitive domains; per-event-type subscriptions.

**Consumer role:**
- [ ] Signature verified on raw bytes before parsing; constant-time comparison; timestamp tolerance enforced (±5 min).
- [ ] Dedupe on event ID with durable store (TTL ≥ retry horizon); handlers idempotent (unique constraints/upserts), out-of-order-safe.
- [ ] Ack-fast/process-async: 2xx only after durable enqueue, well under provider timeout.
- [ ] State derived by fetching current object where staleness matters, not from fat payload alone.
- [ ] Endpoint has body size limits, no cookie-auth dependency, full delivery logging; secrets in a manager with dual-secret rotation support.
