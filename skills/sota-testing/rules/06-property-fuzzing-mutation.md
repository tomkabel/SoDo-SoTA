# 06 — Property-Based Testing, Fuzzing, Mutation & Approval Testing

Techniques that test your tests and explore input space you didn't think of.
Each has a specific ROI profile — apply where it pays, skip where it doesn't.

## 6.1 Property-based testing (PBT)

Example tests check points; properties check *laws over the whole input
space*. The framework generates hundreds of inputs, and on failure
**shrinks** to a minimal counterexample. Mature libraries: Hypothesis
(Python), fast-check (JS/TS), proptest/quickcheck (Rust), jqwik (JVM —
maintenance mode but stable), plus stdlib-adjacent options per language
(see language skills).

**Where PBT pays**: code with open-ended input domains and statable laws —
parsers/serializers, codecs, datetime/money/unit arithmetic, collection and
algorithm implementations, state machines, anything with an inverse or a
slow-but-obviously-correct reference.

**Where it doesn't**: glue/orchestration with no algebra, code whose spec is
"whatever the product owner said", I/O-bound flows. Don't force it.

### The property catalog — what laws to encode

1. **Roundtrip / inverse**: `decode(encode(x)) == x`. The single
   highest-value property; applies to every serializer, parser/printer,
   encrypt/decrypt, to/from-DB mapping.
2. **Invariants**: outputs always satisfy a predicate — sorted output is
   ordered and a permutation of input; balance never negative; output JSON
   always schema-valid.
3. **Oracle / model**: compare optimized implementation against a trivially
   correct one (`fast_search(xs, k) == linear_search(xs, k)`), or new
   implementation against the legacy one during a rewrite.
4. **Metamorphic relations**: can't state the output, but can state how it
   changes — `count(xs ++ ys) == count(xs) + count(ys)`; adding a matching
   document never decreases search results; scaling all inputs scales the
   output.
5. **Idempotence**: `normalize(normalize(x)) == normalize(x)` — for
   sanitizers, formatters, migration steps, CRDT merges.
6. **Commutativity/associativity** where claimed: merge order doesn't
   matter; `a + b == b + a` for your Money type.
7. **Stateful/model-based**: generate command *sequences* against the system
   and a simple in-memory model; assert they agree. The heavyweight option —
   reserve for stateful cores (caches, schedulers, replication) where it
   finds bugs nothing else can.

```python
# Hypothesis: roundtrip + invariant in ~10 lines
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.dictionaries(st.text(), st.integers() | st.text() | st.none()))
def test_config_roundtrip(d):
    assert parse(serialize(d)) == d

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_invariants(xs):
    out = my_sort(xs)
    assert out == sorted(xs)          # oracle
    assert sorted(out) == out          # invariant (redundant w/ oracle; pick one)
```

### Generator and suite discipline

- **Generators must cover the ugly parts** of the domain: empty, unicode
  (combining chars, RTL, NUL), boundaries (0, -1, MAX, leap days, DST),
  duplicates, deeply nested. A generator producing only pretty values is an
  example test with extra steps. Constrain with care: every `filter`/
  `assume` narrows the explored space — prefer constructive generation.
- **Tautology check**: a property that restates the implementation
  (`assert f(x) == f(x)`-shaped) verifies nothing; properties must be derived
  from the spec, not the code.
- **Failures must be reproducible**: keep the framework's failure database /
  printed seed; add each shrunk counterexample as a permanent example test
  (regression pin) — don't rely on the generator refinding it.
- **Budget runtime**: default ~100 cases per property in the PR suite; crank
  iterations in a nightly job, not in everyone's inner loop.
- Shrinking is why you use a framework instead of a `for` loop over
  `random()`: a 2-element minimal counterexample is debuggable, a 4KB random
  blob is not.

## 6.2 Fuzzing

Coverage-guided fuzzing mutates inputs, keeps mutants that reach new code
paths, and runs for hours/days hunting crashes, hangs, and sanitizer
violations. It is PBT's brute-force cousin: no properties needed beyond
"doesn't crash/violate sanitizers" (plus any assertions you embed).

**Fuzz anything that parses untrusted bytes**: file formats, network
protocols, deserializers, decompressors, query languages, anything reachable
from user input in C/C++/unsafe-Rust (memory safety) — but logic bugs and
panics in safe languages too (Go has native fuzzing in the toolchain since
1.18; cargo-fuzz for Rust; Atheris/Jazzer for Python/JVM; per-language detail
in language skills). Engines: AFL++ (actively maintained), libFuzzer (in
maintenance mode — supported, no new features), honggfuzz; for OSS libraries,
continuous fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz.

```go
// Go native fuzz target: corpus seeds + a roundtrip property, not just "no crash"
func FuzzParseConfig(f *testing.F) {
    f.Add([]byte(`{"env":"prod"}`))            // seed corpus
    f.Add([]byte(``))
    f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, data []byte) {
        cfg, err := ParseConfig(data)          // must never panic/hang
        if err != nil {
            return                             // invalid input rejected: fine
        }
        out, err := cfg.Marshal()              // valid input must roundtrip
        if err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("parsed but cannot re-marshal: %v", err)
        }
        if _, err := ParseConfig(out); err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("roundtrip broke: %v", err)
        }
    })
}
```

Discipline:

- **Write the fuzz target like a library API test**: one entry point,
  deterministic, no global state, fast (<ms ideal). Structure-aware fuzzing
  (deriving typed inputs from bytes) reaches deeper than raw-bytes targets.
- **Seed corpus + check it in**: real-world sample inputs make the fuzzer
  productive from minute one; regression corpus (past crashers) runs in the
  PR suite as plain tests — fuzzing finds the bug once, the corpus pins it
  forever.
- **Fuzzing is a background job, not a PR gate**: short smoke-fuzz (seconds
  per target) in CI to keep targets compiling and corpus passing; long runs
  scheduled/continuous with crash triage and dedup.
- Pair with sanitizers (ASan/UBSan/MSan, race detectors) — a fuzzer without
  sanitizers misses most of what it shakes loose in native code.

## 6.3 Mutation testing

Mutation testing answers the question coverage can't: **would the tests
notice if the code were wrong?** Tools mutate the SUT (flip `<` to `<=`,
delete statements, swap constants) and run your tests; surviving mutants =
tests that exercise the line but don't constrain it. Tools: Stryker
(JS/TS, C#, Scala), PIT (JVM), mutmut (Python), cargo-mutants (Rust).

**When it's worth the cost** (it is CPU-expensive — full-suite runs can take
hours):

- **Scoped, not global**: run on the diff (changed files per PR) or on the
  highest-risk modules (`rules/01` §1.4) — money, auth, parsing. A weekly
  diff-scoped job catches weak tests while they're fresh.
- **As an audit probe**: one run on a "well-covered" module tells you in an
  afternoon whether 90% line coverage means anything.

```text
# What a survivor means (PIT/Stryker-style report line)
calculate_interest.py:41  mutated `<` -> `<=`   SURVIVED
# Tests run line 41 (it's "covered") but no test pins the boundary.
# Fix: add the boundary-value test for exactly-at-threshold — not a
# call-count assertion that happens to kill the mutant.
```

**Score interpretation:**

- Don't chase 100% — some mutants are *equivalent* (behaviorally identical
  to the original; undetectable in principle) and some survivors sit in
  consciously-untested code (`rules/01` §1.3). 100% enforced globally makes
  people write interaction-asserting junk tests to kill noise mutants.
- **Read survivors, don't average them.** A surviving mutant in
  `calculate_interest` is a finding; ten in a logging shim are noise. Triage
  like bug reports: kill (add the missing assertion), suppress-with-reason
  (equivalent/dont-care), or accept (documented untested zone).
- Trend per-module mutation score on risk-critical code; a *drop* is the
  signal (new code arriving with weaker tests), the absolute number less so.

## 6.4 Approval testing for legacy code

To change untested legacy code safely, first pin its *current* behavior —
correct or not — then refactor against that pin (characterization tests).

1. Wrap the unit you must change with a harness that captures its complete
   observable output (return values, writes, calls out) for a set of inputs.
2. **Approve** the captured output as a golden file — explicitly unreviewed
   for correctness; it asserts "behavior is unchanged", nothing more.
3. Maximize coverage cheaply: drive with combination/property-style input
   sweeps until line/branch coverage of the target is high (this is the one
   place "coverage as a target" is legitimate — you're measuring the pin's
   grip, not test quality).
4. Refactor under the pin. Then replace approvals incrementally with real
   behavior tests as understanding grows; approvals are scaffolding, not a
   destination — an approval suite older than the refactor it enabled is
   debt (it freezes bugs as requirements).

Difference from snapshot-smell (`rules/02` §2.8): intent. Approval tests are
*deliberately* whole-output and *deliberately* temporary, with a named owner
and an end state.

## 6.5 Chaos / fault-injection (pointer)

Unit/integration layers should already inject failures at boundaries (timeouts,
5xx, partial writes, broker redelivery — `rules/03`, `rules/04`). Beyond
that: chaos engineering (latency/fault injection in real environments,
dependency kill experiments, region failover drills) is an operational
practice with its own blast-radius/abort-condition discipline — run it
against SLOs with observability in place. See `sota-observability` and
`sota-architecture` for resilience patterns; do not bolt chaos experiments
into the CI test suite.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Do parser/serializer/codec modules have roundtrip properties? Grep for
      both a PBT import (`hypothesis|fast-check|proptest|quickcheck|jqwik`)
      and `parse|decode|deserialize` modules; encode/decode pairs with only
      example tests → Medium (High if input is untrusted).
- [ ] Are properties real or tautological? Read each: does the expected side
      re-derive via the SUT's own logic → Critical (verifies nothing).
- [ ] Over-filtered generators? Grep `assume\(|\.filter\(|suchThat|prop_assume`
      density; heavy filtering → Medium (space not actually explored).
- [ ] Are shrunk counterexamples pinned as example tests / failure DB
      committed or cached in CI? No → Low–Medium (regressions can resurface).
- [ ] Anything parsing untrusted bytes WITHOUT a fuzz target? List parsers/
      deserializers reachable from user input; no fuzz target → High for
      native/unsafe code, Medium elsewhere.
- [ ] Crash corpus in the PR suite? Fuzz targets exist but past crashers
      aren't replayed as tests → Medium.
- [ ] Any mutation-testing signal on risk-critical modules (config present:
      `stryker.conf|pitest|mutmut|cargo-mutants`)? None anywhere + high
      coverage claims → Medium (run one probe during the audit if cheap).
- [ ] Mutation score gamed? Tests asserting incidental internals near
      mutation-config thresholds, blanket mutant suppressions without reasons
      → High.
- [ ] Approval/golden suites: do they have an owner and a retirement plan, or
      are 3-year-old approvals still the only tests on refactored code →
      Medium (frozen bugs).
- [ ] PBT runtime in PR suite: properties with cranked iteration counts
      (`max_examples=10000`) in the blocking path → Low (move to nightly).
