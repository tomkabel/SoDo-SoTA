# 06 — Memory & Resource Safety

Scope: integer overflow/truncation, bounds discipline, unsafe-code policy,
untrusted size/length fields, resource exhaustion, concurrency hazards with
security impact. Maps to CWE-190/191/787/125/416/400/770/362.

Core principle: **arithmetic on attacker-influenced numbers is a security
operation.** Most memory-safety exploits start as an integer bug; most outages
start as a missing limit. In memory-safe languages the corruption goes away but
the logic, truncation, and exhaustion bugs remain.

## 1. Integer overflow & truncation (CWE-190/191/197)

- Treat any length, count, offset, size, index, or money amount derived from
  input as hostile: it can be huge, zero, negative, or crafted to wrap.
- Check **before** the operation, in a form that cannot itself overflow:

```c
/* BAD: a+b may wrap before the check */
if (a + b > MAX) reject();
/* GOOD */
if (a > MAX - b) reject();            /* unsigned, b <= MAX */
if (__builtin_add_overflow(a, b, &r)) reject();   /* best: checked intrinsics */
```

- Multiplication for allocation sizing is the classic heap-overflow setup:
  `malloc(count * size)` → use `calloc(count, size)` (checks internally) or
  explicit `count > SIZE_MAX / size` guard (CWE-131).
- Signed/unsigned conversion: a negative `int` length becomes a huge `size_t`
  (CWE-195). Validate signedness/range at the boundary, then use one type
  (`size_t`/`usize`) consistently.
- Truncation: 64→32 bit assignment silently drops high bits — a 4GiB+X length
  truncates to X and passes small-size checks while the real data is huge.
- Language quick reference for input-derived arithmetic:

| Language | Default behavior | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| C/C++ | UB (signed), wrap (unsigned) | `__builtin_*_overflow`, `std::cmp_*` (C++20), UBSan in CI |
| Rust | panic (debug), **wrap (release)** | `checked_*`/`saturating_*`/`try_into()`; `overflow-checks = true` in release profile |
| Go | silent wrap | manual guards, `math/bits.Mul64` carry checks |
| Java | silent wrap | `Math.addExact/multiplyExact`, `long` before narrowing |
| C# | silent wrap | `checked {}` blocks or `/checked` compiler flag |
| JS/TS | precision loss > 2^53 | `Number.isSafeInteger` on ingest, `BigInt` for counters |
| Python | arbitrary precision | still range-check semantics (negative/huge values) |
| SQL | dialect-dependent | constrain columns (`CHECK (qty > 0)`), DECIMAL for money |
- Money/quantities: overflow and negative-amount bugs are business-critical
  (transfer of `-100` credits the attacker). Range-check semantic validity
  (`0 < amount <= LIMIT`), use decimal/integer-cents types, never floats.

```rust
// BAD: wraps silently in release; negative-after-cast passes a < check
let total = price as u32 * qty as u32;

// GOOD: checked, bounded, one unsigned type end-to-end
let qty: u32 = input.qty.try_into().map_err(|_| Invalid)?;
if !(1..=MAX_QTY).contains(&qty) { return Err(Invalid); }
let total = price.checked_mul(qty).ok_or(Overflow)?;
```

## 2. Bounds & buffer discipline (CWE-787/125/120)

- In C/C++: every read/write through a pointer needs a known, checked bound.
  Banned-by-policy: `gets`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`, `scanf("%s")`;
  use `snprintf`, `strlcpy`, or length-explicit APIs — and check *their* return
  values for truncation.
- Off-by-one audit points: `<=` vs `<` against array length, NUL-terminator
  space (`strlen` excludes it), inclusive ranges, loop bounds derived from
  decremented unsigned values (`for (size_t i = n-1; i >= 0; ...)` never ends).
- Prefer structurally safe containers: `std::span`/`std::array::at`,
  `std::string`, Rust slices, Go slices — and keep raw-pointer arithmetic inside
  small, reviewed modules.
- Use-after-free/double-free (CWE-416/415): ownership must be explicit
  (RAII/smart pointers, single owner); null out freed pointers in legacy code;
  beware iterator/reference invalidation on container mutation, and callbacks
  that outlive their captures.
- Build with the mitigations on (they're table stakes, not fixes): ASLR/PIE,
  stack protectors, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`, CFI where available; CI runs ASan/UBSan
  on tests and fuzzers (libFuzzer/AFL++) on every parser of untrusted bytes.
- New-code policy (CISA/NSA memory-safety guidance direction): prefer
  memory-safe languages for new components that parse untrusted input; new C
  is a decision requiring justification, not a default. When extending C/C++,
  isolate parsers in least-privilege processes (sandboxing — seccomp,
  pledge/unveil, AppContainer) so a parser bug is a crash, not a compromise.

```c
/* BAD: trusts decoded length twice over (overflow + over-read) */
uint32_t n = read_u32(pkt);
char *buf = malloc(n + 1);            /* n = 0xFFFFFFFF -> malloc(0) */
memcpy(buf, pkt->data, n);            /* over-read + heap overflow */

/* GOOD */
uint32_t n = read_u32(pkt);
if (n > MAX_MSG || n > pkt->remaining) return ERR_MALFORMED;
char *buf = malloc((size_t)n + 1);
if (!buf) return ERR_OOM;
memcpy(buf, pkt->data, n); buf[n] = '\0';
```

## 3. Unsafe-code policy (Rust `unsafe`, FFI, native modules)

- Default: forbid. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in app crates; `unsafe` allowed
  only in designated low-level crates with:
  - a `// SAFETY:` comment per block stating the invariants and why they hold;
  - the **smallest possible scope** wrapped in a safe API whose type signature
    makes misuse impossible (the safety boundary is the module, not the block);
  - Miri/ASan coverage in CI and mandatory second-reviewer sign-off.
- The same policy applies to FFI surfaces everywhere: JNI, cgo, Python C
  extensions, Node native addons — memory-unsafe code reachable from safe code
  inherits the full C threat model. Validate all data crossing the FFI boundary
  in both directions (lengths, encodings, null-termination).
- `unsafe` justified by "performance" without a benchmark is a finding.

## 4. Untrusted size/length fields (CWE-130/805)

Binary protocol & file-format parsing is where size fields kill:

- **Never allocate or read based on a declared size before sanity-checking it**
  against: protocol maximums, remaining-bytes-actually-available, and global
  memory budget. `length = read_u32(); buf = alloc(length)` is a one-line DoS
  (and with truncation, a heap overflow).
- Cross-check redundant fields: header total-size vs sum of section sizes vs
  actual file size; mismatches → reject, don't "repair".
- Offsets are size fields too: `base + offset` must be bounds-checked post-add
  (overflow-safe, §1) before dereference/seek.
- Decompression: enforce output-size caps and **ratio caps** (zip/gzip/zstd
  bombs, CWE-409); decode images with pixel-count limits before full decode;
  same for XML entity expansion (rules/01 §6).
- Parse with length-aware cursors that return errors on underrun, not raw
  pointer math; fuzz every such parser.

```rust
// GOOD pattern: declared length vs available bytes
let len = cur.read_u32()? as usize;
if len > MAX_RECORD || len > cur.remaining() { return Err(Malformed); }
let body = cur.take(len)?;
```

## 5. Resource exhaustion (CWE-400/770)

Every resource an unauthenticated or cheaply-authenticated request can consume
needs a cap. Inventory: memory, CPU, file descriptors, threads, DB connections,
disk, queue depth, downstream API quota.

- Request limits: max body size (enforced while streaming), max header
  count/size, max URL length, max multipart parts, max JSON depth/keys (deeply
  nested JSON is a parser CPU/stack bomb), max GraphQL query depth/complexity
  and disabled introspection-driven amplification (batching, aliases).
- Timeouts everywhere: server read/write/idle timeouts (slowloris), and
  **every** outbound call (HTTP, DB, DNS, gRPC) gets a deadline — a missing
  client timeout turns a slow dependency into thread-pool exhaustion. Propagate
  cancellation (context/AbortSignal) so abandoned requests stop working.
- Rate limiting: per-principal (user/API key) primary, per-IP secondary
  (IPv6: limit per /64); token-bucket at the edge plus per-endpoint costs for
  expensive operations (search, export, password hashing — argon2id itself is a
  CPU lever, queue/limit login attempts).
- Concurrency caps + bounded queues + load shedding (fail fast with 429/503)
  beat unbounded buffering; unbounded channels/queues just move the OOM.
- Amplification asymmetry: reject work where attacker cost ≪ your cost before
  doing the expensive part (validate-cheap-first ordering; cache negative
  results; require auth before expensive ops).
- Disk: log rotation with caps, temp-file cleanup on all error paths
  (try/finally), quota per tenant for stored artifacts.
- Denial-of-wallet: on serverless/usage-billed infra and metered third-party
  APIs (LLM tokens, SMS, email), exhaustion shows up as your invoice — hard
  budget caps + alerts per tenant/feature, and never let an unauthenticated
  path trigger metered work (SMS-OTP send endpoints are the classic pump).

```go
// GOOD: every outbound call carries a deadline; caller cancellation propagates
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), 2*time.Second)
defer cancel()
row := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, q, id)        // DB
req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", url, nil)  // HTTP
// server side: http.Server{ReadHeaderTimeout, ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout, IdleTimeout}
// all set — Go's zero values are "no timeout", i.e. slowloris-vulnerable by default
```

## 6. Concurrency hazards with security impact (CWE-362/367)

- TOCTOU on filesystems: check-then-use (`access()` then `open()`) races against
  symlink swaps — use `open` with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_EXCL` semantics, operate on the
  fd (`fstat`, `openat`), not the re-resolved path (CWE-367/59).
- Race-driven logic bypass: balance checks, coupon redemption, invite
  acceptance, rate counters — concurrent requests pass the same check before
  either writes. Fix with DB-level guarantees: atomic conditional updates
  (`UPDATE ... WHERE balance >= x`), unique constraints, `SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE`/serializable transactions, or idempotency keys — never in-process
  locks across multiple instances.

```sql
-- BAD: check in app code, then write (two requests both pass the check)
-- SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id=$1;  ... if balance >= amt: UPDATE ...

-- GOOD: the check IS the write; 0 rows affected = insufficient funds
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - $2
 WHERE id = $1 AND balance >= $2;

-- GOOD: single-use tokens/coupons via atomic claim
UPDATE coupons SET used_by = $1, used_at = now()
 WHERE code = $2 AND used_by IS NULL;
```
- Shared mutable state across requests (globals, class attributes in pooled
  workers) leaks one user's data into another's response — keep request state
  request-scoped; audit caches and reused buffers for cross-request bleed.
- Signal/reentrancy handlers and async callbacks touching shared security state
  need the same discipline.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Is all arithmetic on input-derived sizes/counts/offsets/amounts overflow-checked (checked intrinsics or pre-condition form) before use?
- [ ] Are allocation sizes guarded against multiplication overflow and capped against a memory budget?
- [ ] Are signed/unsigned conversions and 64→32 truncations on lengths eliminated or explicitly range-checked?
- [ ] Do money/quantity fields enforce positive, bounded, integer/decimal semantics?
- [ ] Are banned C string functions absent and parsers of untrusted bytes fuzzed with sanitizers in CI?
- [ ] Is `unsafe`/FFI code confined to designated modules with SAFETY comments, safe wrappers, and Miri/ASan coverage?
- [ ] Does every declared length/offset get validated against bytes-actually-available before allocation or read?
- [ ] Are decompression ratio caps, image pixel limits, and JSON/GraphQL depth+complexity limits enforced?
- [ ] Do all inbound listeners and outbound calls have timeouts, with cancellation propagation?
- [ ] Is rate limiting per-principal with bounded queues and load shedding (no unbounded buffering)?
- [ ] Are check-then-act sequences (files, balances, redemptions) made atomic at the storage layer?
- [ ] Is request-scoped data verified never to live in shared/global state across requests?
