# 06 — Incident Response & Detection Validation

Detection without response is an alarm nobody answers; response without
validated detections is improvisation under fire. This rule covers both ends:
the IR lifecycle that turns an alert into a contained, learned-from incident,
and the adversary-emulation discipline that proves your detections actually fire
*before* a real adversary tests them for you. Read this when building IR
capability, writing playbooks, handling an incident, or setting up continuous
detection validation. Also the **AUDIT-mode entry point** alongside rules/04.

## 1. The IR lifecycle

The classic model is **PICERL** (Preparation, Identification, Containment,
Eradication, Recovery, Lessons learned). The current authoritative reference is
**NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3** (finalized April 2025), which reframes incident
response around the **CSF 2.0** functions — Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect,
Respond, Recover — emphasizing IR as continuous risk management woven into the
six functions rather than a standalone linear sequence (verify at
csrc.nist.gov). PICERL remains a fine operational mnemonic; map it onto the
CSF-aligned model:

- **Preparation / Govern+Identify+Protect** — the work done *before*: plan,
  roles, authority-to-contain, contacts, tooling, logging (rules/02), playbooks,
  tabletops. Most incidents are won or lost here.
- **Identification / Detect** — your detections, hunts, and deception (rules/03,
  /05) surface it; triage (rules/04) confirms scope and severity.
- **Containment / Respond** — stop the spread: isolate, disable, block, revoke.
  Short-term (stop bleeding) then long-term (sustainable lockdown).
- **Eradication / Respond** — remove the foothold: kill persistence, rotate
  compromised creds (sota-secrets-management), patch the entry vector.
- **Recovery / Recover** — restore to known-good, monitor for re-entry, validate
  the threat is gone before declaring done.
- **Lessons learned / Recover→Govern** — blameless PIR (§5) that feeds new
  detections and closes the loop back to Preparation.

## 2. Playbooks & severity classification

- **Playbooks per incident type** (account compromise, ransomware, cloud-key
  abuse, data exfil, K8s/container compromise, LLM/agent abuse) — concrete,
  step-by-step, with decision points and named roles. Distinct from a *runbook*
  (rules/04, per-alert triage); a playbook governs the whole incident.
- **Severity classification** drives the response tier (who's paged, how fast,
  whether leadership/legal/comms engage). Define levels by business impact +
  scope + data sensitivity, agreed in advance — not argued during the incident.
- **Declare incidents decisively.** Hesitation to call an incident is a common,
  costly failure. Err toward declaring; downgrading is cheap, lost early hours
  are not.

## 3. Forensic readiness, evidence & chain of custody

You cannot collect in the moment what you didn't prepare to collect.

- **Forensic readiness** — sufficient, integrity-protected, long-retained
  telemetry (rules/02) and the ability to snapshot volatile state (memory, disk,
  container/pod, cloud resource) before it's destroyed. Cloud/container
  ephemerality is the trap: a terminated pod or scaled-down instance takes its
  evidence with it — snapshot/preserve *before* containment kills it.
- **Evidence handling & chain of custody** — for anything that may support legal
  action or attribution: record who collected what, when, from where, and every
  subsequent handoff; hash evidence on collection and verify integrity; store
  read-only with access logging. A broken chain of custody can void the evidence
  entirely.
- **Order of volatility** — capture the most ephemeral first (memory, network
  state) before the durable (disk, logs).

## 4. Containment/eradication/recovery discipline

- **Contain before you eradicate, eradicate before you recover** — but preserve
  evidence first (§3). Pulling the plug destroys memory forensics; isolate
  (network-quarantine) instead where you need the box live.
- **Scope before you eradicate.** Eradicating one host while the adversary holds
  three others just tips them off. Use the incident's correlated entities
  (rules/04) and a hunt (rules/05) to size blast radius first.
- **Rotate all potentially exposed credentials** during eradication (assume the
  adversary took everything reachable) — coordinate with sota-secrets-management.
- **Recovery requires monitoring for re-entry** — heightened detection on the
  affected entities for a defined window; adversaries commonly return.

## 5. Blameless post-incident review (PIR)

- **Blameless** — focus on systemic/process gaps, not individual fault. Blame
  suppresses the honest disclosure that makes the review useful, and the next
  incident will be hidden longer.
- **Outputs that feed the loop:** for each "we didn't detect this early enough,"
  a new detection hypothesis (rules/01); for each "the runbook was wrong," a
  runbook fix (rules/04); for each "we couldn't get the evidence," a forensic-
  readiness gap (§3). A PIR that produces no detection/process changes was
  theater.
- **Track timeline metrics** (time to detect, contain, eradicate, recover) to
  measure whether the program is improving incident over incident.

## 6. Tabletop exercises

- Walk through realistic scenarios with the actual responders before a real
  incident. Tabletops find the broken phone tree, the missing authority-to-
  contain, the playbook nobody can locate — cheaply.
- Exercise the *decisions* (who can isolate prod? who calls legal? when do we
  notify?) and the *contacts* (are they current?). Run them regularly; rotate
  scenarios to match your top threats (threat modeling) and recent intel
  (rules/05).

## 7. Detection validation via adversary emulation (for defense)

**Validation is mandatory and defensive.** You run attacker techniques against
*your own* environment to prove your detections fire and your response works —
this is purple teaming and regression testing, not offense. A detection that's
never been triggered by the real technique is unproven.

Tools (verify current status at each project):

- **Atomic Red Team** (Red Canary) — a large library of small, ATT&CK-mapped
  "atomic" tests (~1,000+ tests across 200+ techniques). Run one atomic, confirm
  the mapped detection fires. The unit-test of detections; ideal for CI
  regression (rules/01 §2). github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.
- **MITRE Caldera** (now an Apache project, apache/caldera) — automated,
  campaign-style adversary emulation: chains techniques into an end-to-end
  operation to test detection *across the kill chain*, not just per-atomic.
- **Stratus Red Team** (DataDog) — cloud-native emulation (AWS/Azure/GCP/K8s);
  emulates cloud control-plane TTPs to validate cloud-audit detections (rules/02).
  github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team. Pairs with the cloud/K8s/identity attacks
  the sibling skills prevent.
- **Breach-and-attack-simulation (BAS)** — continuous, automated emulation
  platforms for ongoing coverage assurance.

### Purple teaming & regression

- **Purple teaming** — red (emulate) and blue (detect/respond) work *together* in
  real time: run a technique, watch whether it's detected, tune on the spot,
  re-run. The fastest way to turn coverage gaps into detections.
- **Detection regression testing** — wire atomic tests into CI so a change that
  silently breaks a detection (a renamed field, a pipeline change, rules/02)
  fails the build, not the next incident. This is the test half of detection-as-
  code (rules/01 §2).
- **Continuous coverage assessment** — schedule emulation against the ATT&CK
  techniques in your threat model and update the Navigator layer (rules/01 §5)
  with *validated* (not merely *existing*) coverage. The honest coverage map is
  the one backed by a passing emulation.

### AI-system validation

For LLM/agent systems, validate detection of the threats in **MITRE ATLAS**
(the AI-system counterpart to ATT&CK; 16 tactics / 84 techniques as of early
2026 — verify at atlas.mitre.org) and sota-code-security rules/08: emulate
prompt-injection, tool/agent abuse, and model-exfil attempts against your own
agents and confirm runtime detections fire.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Is there a written IR plan mapped to a current standard (NIST SP 800-61r3
      / CSF 2.0), with roles, severity tiers, and authority-to-contain defined
      *before* an incident?
- [ ] Are there incident-type playbooks (account compromise, ransomware, cloud-
      key abuse, data exfil, container, LLM/agent abuse) — concrete and current?
- [ ] Is forensic readiness real: can you snapshot a pod/instance/memory *before*
      containment destroys it, especially for ephemeral cloud/container workloads?
- [ ] Is there a chain-of-custody process (collector, time, hashing, read-only
      storage, access logging) for evidence that may be used legally?
- [ ] Does containment preserve evidence and scope blast radius before
      eradication, and rotate all exposed credentials?
- [ ] Are post-incident reviews blameless, and do they *produce* new detections/
      runbook fixes/forensic-gap closures (not just a doc)?
- [ ] Are tabletop exercises run regularly with the real responders, exercising
      decisions and verifying contacts are current?
- [ ] Are detections **validated against the real technique** via Atomic Red
      Team / Caldera / Stratus before they're trusted? Pick 5 — how many have a
      passing emulation test?
- [ ] Is detection regression testing wired into CI so a broken detection fails
      the build?
- [ ] Is coverage continuously assessed via emulation/purple-teaming, and does
      the Navigator reflect *validated* coverage?
- [ ] For LLM/agent systems, are ATLAS-class threats (prompt injection, agent
      abuse) emulated against your own agents to validate runtime detection?
