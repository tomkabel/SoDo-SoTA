  Master router for the SOTA engineering skills library. Use this skill whenever the user asks to build, design, implement, refactor, harden, optimize, review, or audit an application, service, or codebase and the request spans more than one domain — or when you are unsure which specific sota-* skill applies. It maps the task (build mode or audit mode) to the right domain skills (architecture, code security, threat modeling, secrets, sandboxing, performance, async/concurrency, APIs/websockets, devsecops, databases, frontend/UI/UX/motion, observability, testing, LLM engineering, cloud infrastructure, kubernetes, identity & access, network security, detection engineering, data engineering, privacy/compliance, mobile, CLI UX, shell scripting, docs/workflow) and language skills (Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript), and defines how to run a full multi-domain audit. Trigger keywords: SOTA, best practices, audit my code, security review, full review, hardening, production readiness, code quality.

# SOTA Engineering Skills — Master Router

A library of 29 domain skills, each with a `SKILL.md` entry point and a `rules/`
folder of focused rule files (every file < 500 lines). Each skill works in two
modes:

- **BUILD** — apply the rules while designing or writing code.
- **AUDIT** — review existing code against the rules and emit findings in the
  canonical format below (it supersedes any per-skill variant):
  `file:line | rule violated | severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info) |
  effort (trivial/small/medium/large) | fix`.

Read only what the task needs: first the relevant skill's `SKILL.md` (it has its
own index of `rules/` files with "read this when..." guidance), then only the
rules files that match the code in front of you. Never load all skills at once.

## Operating principles (always apply)

0. **Validate every claim — mandatory.** No claim ships unvalidated, in any
   mode. A claim is validated only by checking it against a primary source:
   code read in full context at the pinned commit (for findings), official
   docs/release notes/advisories fetched at use time (for versions, specs,
   CVEs, tool capabilities), or a reproduced behavior (for bugs). Training
   data, plausibility, and "the rules file says so" do not validate anything.
   What cannot be validated is either omitted or explicitly marked
   "needs verification" — never asserted.
1. **Freshness first.** The library's version/spec/regulation facts were
   web-verified as of the last refresh (see README). Never trust them — or
   training data — for anything version- or CVE-sensitive at use time:
   re-verify current releases and advisories before pinning or recommending.
2. **Stop-and-ask on security-relevant decisions.** When a choice materially
   affects security posture (authn/z model, crypto primitive, trust boundary,
   secrets handling, network exposure), present the options with a
   recommendation and ask before proceeding. Do not silently pick.
3. **Evidence over vibes.** Every audit finding cites file:line, maps to a
   standard (CWE, OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK/ATLAS) where one applies, and proposes a
   concrete fix. Uncertain findings are marked "needs verification", never
   asserted. Borderline severities state the deciding assumption ("High if
   internet-facing; Medium if internal-only").
4. **Stack profile.** If the repo or `~/.claude` contains a `profiles/*.md`
   stack profile (preferred stores, auth provider, license policy, platform
   conventions), its choices are the defaults for BUILD mode and the expected
   baseline for AUDIT mode.

## Cross-cutting routing rules

1. **Language skills stack on domain skills.** Auditing a Go API server →
   `sota-golang` + `sota-api-design` + `sota-code-security`. The language skill
   covers idioms and runtime-specific traps; domain skills cover the design.
2. **Security tasks usually need three skills.** Code-level flaws →
   `sota-code-security`; design-level gaps → `sota-threat-modeling`; leaked or
   mishandled credentials → `sota-secrets-management`. Pipeline/supply-chain →
   `sota-devsecops`; isolation blast-radius → `sota-sandboxing`.
3. **Performance complaints about queries** → start in `sota-databases`
   (EXPLAIN, indexes, N+1) before `sota-performance` (caching, I/O).
4. **Anything realtime** (websockets, SSE, pub/sub fanout) →
   `sota-api-design` rules/05 + `sota-async-concurrency` (backpressure).
5. **AI/LLM features** → `sota-code-security` rules/08 (prompt injection,
   tool authorization) + `sota-sandboxing` rules/05 (executing model output) +
   `sota-databases` rules/07 (vectors/RAG).
6. **Frontend work** → `sota-frontend-design` for design/UX/a11y/motion;
   `sota-javascript-typescript` for the code; `sota-performance` rules/06 for
   Web Vitals.
7. **Tests accompany everything.** Any BUILD task that writes logic also loads
   `sota-testing` (strategy + design rules); any AUDIT includes a suite-health
   pass. Language-specific runner mechanics stay in the language skills.
8. **LLM features split three ways.** Quality/architecture →
   `sota-llm-engineering`; security (prompt injection, tool authz) →
   `sota-code-security` rules/08; executing model output → `sota-sandboxing`
   rules/05; PII in prompts/logs → `sota-privacy-compliance`.
9. **Infra layers split four ways.** Cloud-provider setup (accounts, VPC,
   compute, cost, DR) → `sota-cloud-infrastructure`; the Kubernetes platform
   itself (RBAC, admission, GitOps controllers, operators, etcd) →
   `sota-kubernetes`; pod/container/workload isolation mechanics →
   `sota-sandboxing`; CI/CD and supply chain → `sota-devsecops`. A K8s cluster
   audit loads `sota-kubernetes` + `sota-network-security` + `sota-sandboxing`.
13. **Identity is its own layer.** App-level login/session/JWT-validation code →
   `sota-code-security` rules/02-03; identity *infrastructure* (IdP, OIDC/SAML
   config, RBAC/role-mapping design, provisioning, break-glass, SPIFFE) →
   `sota-identity-access`; the credentials themselves → `sota-secrets-management`.
14. **Network: setup vs security.** Cloud VPC/DNS/CDN provisioning →
   `sota-cloud-infrastructure` rules/03; segmentation, zero-trust, NetworkPolicy
   depth, service mesh/mTLS, egress/DNS/PKI posture → `sota-network-security`.
15. **Prevention vs detection.** Building the control → the relevant domain
   skill; verifying you'd *catch* the attack at runtime (logs, rules, hunting,
   IR) → `sota-detection-engineering`. Ops telemetry plumbing stays in
   `sota-observability`; design-time threat enumeration in `sota-threat-modeling`.
16. **Ingesting untrusted/attacker-authored data** (feeds, scraping, uploads,
   webhooks, RAG corpora, hostile parsers) → `sota-code-security` rules/09,
   with `sota-sandboxing` rules/04 for parser isolation.
10. **Data: OLTP vs analytics.** App databases → `sota-databases`; pipelines,
    streaming, warehouse/lakehouse → `sota-data-engineering`; anything touching
    personal data → add `sota-privacy-compliance`.
11. **Any handling of user/personal data** (new fields, exports, logs,
    analytics, ML training) → check `sota-privacy-compliance` minimization and
    retention rules, even when the task isn't "about" privacy.
12. **Shell scripts hide everywhere** — CI run blocks, Dockerfile RUN lines,
    Makefiles, entrypoints. Audit them with `sota-shell-scripting` even when
    the repo's "language" is something else.

## BUILD mode — workflow

1. Identify the domains the feature touches (table above) and the language(s).
2. Read each relevant skill's `SKILL.md`; from its index, open only the rules
   files matching the work (e.g. adding a websocket endpoint → api-design
   rules/05, async rules/06, code-security rules/02 for auth at upgrade).
3. Apply the **top-10 non-negotiables** of every loaded skill unconditionally;
   apply detailed rules as the code demands.
4. Before finishing, run each loaded rules file's **Audit checklist** against
   your own diff — every rules file ends with one.

## AUDIT mode — workflow

Process and reporting are governed by `rules/01-audit-methodology.md` — read it
first for any full audit: scoping/rules-of-engagement, the verified tool
matrix and triage discipline, the evidence standard, and the report template.

For a focused audit, load the matching skills and follow their AUDIT sections.
For a **full project audit**, work in passes:

1. **Recon.** Inventory the repo: languages, frameworks, entry points (HTTP
   routes, queues, cron, webhooks), data stores, CI config, Dockerfiles, IaC.
   This determines which skills apply; skip skills with no matching surface.
2. **Threat model first.** `sota-threat-modeling` rules/06 (reconstruction):
   assets, trust boundaries, entry points. Its output prioritizes the rest.
3. **Per-domain passes.** For each applicable skill, follow its AUDIT mode and
   audit checklists. Suggested order: secrets sweep (fast, high yield) →
   code security (incl. rules/09 untrusted-data ingestion) → language-specific
   (incl. shell scripts) → API → database → async/concurrency →
   identity & access → sandboxing/devsecops → kubernetes platform →
   network security → cloud infrastructure → privacy/compliance → architecture
   → testing suite health → performance → observability → detection-engineering
   posture → frontend/a11y → LLM features, data pipelines, mobile, CLI, docs as
   applicable. For an infrastructure/cluster audit the heavy hitters are
   `sota-kubernetes`, `sota-network-security`, `sota-identity-access`,
   `sota-sandboxing`, and `sota-detection-engineering`.
4. **Findings.** Emit every finding in the canonical format
   (`file:line | rule | severity | effort | fix`), deduplicate across domains,
   and roll up into the report structure from `rules/01-audit-methodology.md`:
   executive summary → scope & methodology → findings by severity →
   remediation roadmap sequenced by risk-reduction-per-effort → positive
   observations → appendix. Severity meanings:
   - **Critical** — exploitable now or data-loss risk; fix before anything else.
   - **High** — serious weakness or reliability hazard; fix this sprint.
   - **Medium** — deviation from SOTA with real but bounded impact.
   - **Low** — hygiene, polish, future-proofing.
   - **Info** — no direct risk: observations, tech-debt notes, future-proofing.
5. **Verify before reporting.** Re-read each Critical/High finding's code in
   full context; drop or downgrade anything you cannot substantiate with a
   concrete failure scenario, or mark it "needs verification".

## Context budget discipline

Each rules file is 200–310 lines. A typical focused task needs 2–5 rules files;
a full audit pass should load one skill at a time, finish its findings, then
move on. If context is tight, prefer the skill's top-10 non-negotiables plus
the single most relevant rules file.
