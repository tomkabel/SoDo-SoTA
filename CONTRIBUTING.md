# Contributing to SOTA-skills

Thanks for helping improve the library. SOTA-skills is a collection of Markdown
skills that an AI assistant reads to build and audit software using
state-of-the-art practices. There is no code to run — contributions are edits to
Markdown, held to a few hard invariants.

By contributing you agree your contribution is licensed under
[CC BY 4.0](LICENSE), the same as the rest of the library.

## Ground rules

1. **Keep it generic.** The library must apply to anyone. Do not hard-code one
   person's or company's stack, project names, or infrastructure. Name products
   only as neutral *examples* ("e.g. PostgreSQL"), never as an assumption about
   the reader ("you run PostgreSQL"). Personalization belongs in a local
   `profiles/<you>.md`, which is git-ignored and never committed.
2. **Verify every claim.** Fast-moving facts (versions, specs, advisories,
   regulations) must be checked against a **primary source** — a spec, vendor
   doc, CVE/CWE, or official release — and cited. Prefer "needs verification"
   over a confident guess. The library's value is that its claims hold up.
3. **Stay lean.** Every Markdown file is **≤ 500 lines** so skills load
   incrementally without blowing the context window. If a topic outgrows that,
   split it into another `rules/NN-topic.md`.

## Anatomy of a skill

**`SKILL.md`**

- YAML frontmatter with exactly two fields: `name` and `description`. If the
   description contains a colon, use a block scalar (`>` or `|`) so the YAML stays
   valid. Duplicate or extra frontmatter fields fail the invariant check.
- A `description` that says *when* to use the skill (BUILD and AUDIT triggers)
  and a list of trigger keywords — Claude Code matches prompts against this.
- Body: a short "when to use", a **BUILD** workflow and an **AUDIT** workflow, a
  **top-10 non-negotiables** list, and a **rules index** table pointing at the
  `rules/` files.

**`rules/NN-topic.md`**

- 150–340 lines of concrete, current guidance with short examples.
- Ends with an **`## Audit checklist`** — yes/no questions, ideally with
  grep/lint patterns, so the rule can be used to hunt violations.

**Findings format** (AUDIT mode, used throughout):

```
file:line | rule violated | severity | effort | fix
```

- Severity: **Critical** · **High** · **Medium** · **Low** · **Info**
- Effort: **trivial** · **small** · **medium** · **large**

Borderline severities should state the deciding assumption; unconfirmed findings
are marked "needs verification", never asserted.

## The invariants (enforced)

`scripts/check-invariants.sh` runs in pre-commit and CI and fails the build on:

1. any tracked `*.md` over **500 lines**;
2. invalid `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter, duplicate/extra fields, or a
   description over **1024 characters**;
3. any `skills/*/rules/*.md` whose final `##` section is not
   **`## Audit checklist`**;
4. any **internal/private reference** leaking into tracked files.

Secrets are scanned separately by **gitleaks** (config in `.gitleaks.toml`).

## Local setup

```sh
pipx install pre-commit     # or: brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install          # run the same checks on every commit
```

The invariant checker uses Python 3 and `PyYAML` for real YAML parsing. The
pre-commit hook provisions `PyYAML==6.0.2` automatically; for direct script runs
outside pre-commit, install that package in your active Python environment.

Run the invariant checks any time:

```sh
./scripts/check-invariants.sh
```

When editing the invariant checker itself, also run
`python3 -m unittest scripts/test_check_invariants.py`.

## Submitting a change

1. Fork and branch (`git checkout -b improve-sota-databases-indexing`).
2. Make the edit; keep diffs focused (one skill / one concern per PR).
3. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` (or at least `./scripts/check-invariants.sh`).
4. Open a PR describing **what** changed, **why**, and **how the claims were
   verified** (cite sources for any new version/spec/advisory claim).

### PR checklist

- [ ] Stays generic — no personal/company stack, project names, or "you run X".
- [ ] New fast-moving claims cite a primary source.
- [ ] Every touched `rules/*.md` still ends with `## Audit checklist`.
- [ ] All touched files are ≤ 500 lines.
- [ ] No secrets in examples (masked/placeholder only).
- [ ] `pre-commit` / `scripts/check-invariants.sh` passes.

## Adding a whole new skill

Same structure: a `skills/sota-<domain>/` folder with a `SKILL.md` (two-field
frontmatter, BUILD/AUDIT workflows, top-10, rules index) and `rules/NN-*.md`
files each ending in an audit checklist. Add the skill to the router
(`skills/sota/SKILL.md`) routing table and to the table in `README.md`. Open an
issue first if you want to discuss scope.

## Questions

Open an issue. For anything security-sensitive (bad security guidance, or a real
secret accidentally committed), follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.
